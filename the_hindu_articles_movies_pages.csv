Big-star filmmaking is now plagued by a lack of know-how in building IPs for the long run, and the trend of splitting the story of one film into two for the sake of a sequel A two-film-strong, 340-minute-long cat-and-mouse game comes to an end in director Sukumar’s Pushpa 2: The Rule. A climactic scene ambiguously ends the arc, urging audiences to ready themselves to leave, only to be compelled back to their seats for 40 more minutes. The extended climax of the Allu Arjun-starrer, meant as a segue to a third Pushpa film, is an excruciatingly tedious episode that leaves you with a poor aftertaste — it’s a cold shower moment in this otherwise ‘wildfire’ of a film. This is a new fad picked up by commercial filmmakers of the pan-India movement — franchising, for better monetisation or to secure a working formula for the future. Most big-ticket films these days either end with a cliffhanger, depriving audiences of the satisfaction of a complete product, or add a surprise climactic cameo to end on a high note and make way for a sequel. Suriya’s Kanguvawas undoubtedly an untested attempt in Tamil, but the makers were quick to jump on this bandwagon, with a surprise cameo by Karthi and a hook to keep us waiting for the second part.

‘The Red Virgin’ movie review: Impeccable performances anchor this tale of parenthood and principles,A fantastic Najwa Nimri and a restrained performance from Alba Planas make Paula Ortiz’s directorial a near-perfect historical drama,Gopinath Rajendran,"‘The Red Virgin’ movie review: Impeccable performances anchor this tale of parenthood and principles A fantastic Najwa Nimri and a restrained performance from Alba Planas make Paula Ortiz’s directorial a near-perfect historical drama Aware of the term ‘Eugenics’? A quick Google search reveals it to be a “set of beliefs and practices that aim to improve the genetic quality of a human population”. Director Paula Ortiz, in her recent Prime Video outing The Red Virgin, takes the blood-stained pages from history and turns them into a biopic of one of several personalities whose works were forgotten after the Spanish Civil War. The Red Virgin is based on the real-life story of Aurora (Najwa Nimri), the eugenicist and feminist mother of Hildegart (Alba Planas), who she conceived as a scientific experiment to represent the woman of the future. Born to be the perfect prototype, Hildegart turns out to be a prodigy; a child political activist, who, even before turning a teen, gave conferences on feminism and female sexuality. But as Hildegart hits the later part of her teenage, the authoritarian hold Aurora had over her daughter slips a little causing the duo to react which leads to a point of no return.",https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/the-red-virgin-movie-review-impeccable-performances-anchor-this-tale-of-parenthood-and-principles/article68959172.ece,movies

Here are some war movies — with unusual heroes — that don’t simplify the story to stick to a formula The recent Tamil blockbuster Amaran opens with a visually arresting action set piece. Yet my favourite scene is when the protagonist, Major Mukund Varadarajan (played by Sivakarthikeyan), convinces the father of his girlfriend, Indhu Rebecca Varghese (essayed by Sai Pallavi), to get them married. Mukund loves Rebecca just as much as he worships the Indian Army. He calls her his ‘uyir’ (life).

Critical measures: should film reviews on social media platforms be banned?,"In a post-internet world, the know-how of film criticism is scattered but accessible, and the growing passion for movies has enabled audiences to read films more sensibly. Therefore, a gag order on a platform censors every voice, good or bad",Bhuvanesh Chandar,"Critical measures: should film reviews on social media platforms be banned? In a post-internet world, the know-how of film criticism is scattered but accessible, and the growing passion for movies has enabled audiences to read films more sensibly. Therefore, a gag order on a platform censors every voice, good or bad Earlier this week, the Tamil Film Active Producers Association (TFAPA) filed a writ petition in the Madras High Court, seeking a ban on movie reviews on social media for the first three days of release. The counsel representing the TFAPA listed three reasons that necessitated the request — review bombing through reviews shot in cinema theatres, stage-managing fake reviews by purchasing bulk tickets, and intentionally propagating a negative image of the film through fake social media accounts. These are pivotal concerns that need redressal and creators must be protected from targeted harassment. Paid reviews are real and, as Taapsee Pannu recently quoted Shah Rukh Khan as saying, are nothing more than advertisement spaces for sale. And so when the said space is used to unfairly demean a film, a business, or an entity, the legislature needs to step in and protect the affected parties. However, concerns also arise about the apparent discrepancies in how film chambers navigate these issues; like the ambiguity in using terms like ‘reviewers,’; the irony in how YouTube reviews are used when favourable and flattering; and who is referred to as a ‘reviewer’.",https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/critical-measures-should-film-reviews-on-social-media-platforms-be-banned/article68950810.ece,movies

‘Agni’ movie review: Pratik Gandhi blazes a trail in this tale of courage under fire,"Filled with warm and chilling moments, Rahul Dholakia’s social thriller provides firefighters with their moment under the sun",Anuj Kumar,"‘Agni’ movie review: Pratik Gandhi blazes a trail in this tale of courage under fire Filled with warm and chilling moments, Rahul Dholakia’s social thriller provides firefighters with their moment under the sun In Indian tradition, fire alludes to love and conflict, devotion and anger, eternality and death. The ever-youthful element that demands sacrifice plays the central character in director Rahul Dholakia’s ode to the unstinting spirit of the firefighters. Capturing a daze’s multiple faces and colours, Dholakia removes the smokescreen that covers the firefighters’ work and opens a window into the lives of those who keep us out of its fury but whose services are not duly acknowledged by the system and society. The action takes us into the heart of the evacuation process, the drama unravels the sacrifices firefighters make and the thriller elements seek to find the answer to the source of the firestorm. Fireman Vithal (Pratik Gandhi) and policeman Samit (Divyendu) are brothers-in-law. The relationship seems like a pun on the two arms of the Department of Home Affairs. Both undermine each other’s contribution, both learn to live with each other. While Vithal questions the methods and celebrity-like status of Samit, the latter finds Vithal unnecessarily grumpy. When there is a sudden surge in cases of arson in Mumbai, the two have to put their differences on the back burner to douse the inferno.",https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/agni-movie-review-pratik-gandhi-blazes-a-trail-in-this-tale-of-courage-under-fire/article68954002.ece,movies

Is it a horror-thriller? Or is it just plain existential dread? You truly wonder who these people are, what they are doing, and why they all seem to have no relation to each other. It is only in episode 4 that clarity dawns, and things seemingly fall into place in this mystery-horror television show. Written by Kang Full who made 2023’s complex and expansive superhero K-Drama Moving, Light Shop has also been adapted from his webtoon of the same name.

Big-star filmmaking is now plagued by a lack of know-how in building IPs for the long run, and the trend of splitting the story of one film into two for the sake of a sequel A two-film-strong, 340-minute-long cat-and-mouse game comes to an end in director Sukumar’s Pushpa 2: The Rule. A climactic scene ambiguously ends the arc, urging audiences to ready themselves to leave, only to be compelled back to their seats for 40 more minutes. The extended climax of the Allu Arjun-starrer, meant as a segue to a third Pushpa film, is an excruciatingly tedious episode that leaves you with a poor aftertaste — it’s a cold shower moment in this otherwise ‘wildfire’ of a film. This is a new fad picked up by commercial filmmakers of the pan-India movement — franchising, for better monetisation or to secure a working formula for the future. Most big-ticket films these days either end with a cliffhanger, depriving audiences of the satisfaction of a complete product, or add a surprise climactic cameo to end on a high note and make way for a sequel. Suriya’s Kanguvawas undoubtedly an untested attempt in Tamil, but the makers were quick to jump on this bandwagon, with a surprise cameo by Karthi and a hook to keep us waiting for the second part.

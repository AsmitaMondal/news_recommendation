This project is a cutting-edge News Recommendation System that brings you real-time news updates by scraping articles from *The Hindu* website across categories such as National, International, Science, Health, Business, and Movies. Leveraging a powerful Deep Q-Learning (DQN) algorithm, the system learns from your interactions—likes, dislikes, and reads—to recommend articles tailored to your preferences. The app not only suggests articles from your favorite categories but also tracks and displays user interaction statistics. With each session, the recommendation engine continuously evolves to deliver increasingly relevant content, ensuring an engaging and personalized news experience.

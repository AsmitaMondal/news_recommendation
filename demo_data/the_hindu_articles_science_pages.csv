Fresh corroboration of the perplexing observation that the universe is expanding more rapidly than expected has scientists pondering the cause - perhaps some unknown factor involving the mysterious cosmic components dark energy and dark matter. Two years of data from NASA's James Webb Space Telescope have now validated the Hubble Space Telescope's earlier finding that the rate of the universe's expansion is faster - by about 8% - than would be expected based on what astrophysicists know of the initial conditions in the cosmos and its evolution over billions of years.

Premium Researchers have identified two distinct groups of Indian star tortoises, so simply releasing seized individuals into nearby forests could be unscientific The Indian star tortoise (Geochelone elegans) is a sight to behold, with its obsidian shell and the striking Sun-yellow star patterns adorning it. These tortoises are hardy herbivores and are popular as exotic house pets — but they shouldn’t be. It’s illegal to own one in India but also unethical since they are vulnerable in the wild. Endemic to the subcontinent, Indian star tortoises reside in arid pockets of northwest India (bordering Pakistan), South India, and Sri Lanka. However, members of the species have also been found in people’s homes as far afield as Canada and the U.S. The increasing demand for them as pets has entangled them in one of the largest global wildlife trafficking networks.",https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/energy-and-environment/study-brings-indian-star-tortoise-to-evidence-based-conservation/article68961578.ece,science

Premium Genetically modified malaria-causing parasites do not cause disease; they instead prime the immune system during the initial stage of their life cycle in the liver Two vaccines against malaria have been rolled out in some countries in Africa. Besides vaccines, scientists have been using genetically altered mosquitoes to stop the spread of malaria. One is the release of radiation-sterilised male mosquitoes to prevent eggs from hatching. Another is engineering mosquitoes that slow the growth of malaria-causing parasites in the gut thereby preventing transmission of malaria to humans. The other method is using genetically modified mosquitoes that can spread resistance to malaria-causing parasites by thriving and mating with wild mosquitoes. Now, in a radical approach, scientists have shifted their focus from genetic modification of malaria-causing mosquitoes to malaria-causing parasites. They have genetically modified malaria-causing parasites so that the parasites do not cause disease. Instead, they prime the immune system during the initial stage of their life cycle in the liver and before they enter the bloodstream.

Scientists first discovered it as a small fragment of genetic material in cancer cells 50 years ago. Because it was present in only 1.4% of tumours, they didn’t consider it to be important. But more sophisticated genomic techniques later revealed their mistake: one study published in 2017 revealed ecDNA is present in nearly 40% of cancer cell lines and in up to 90% of patient-derived brain tumour samples, revealing its pivotal role in cancer biology.",https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/science/extrachromosomal-dna-challenges-law-of-genetics-groundbreaking-studies/article68941909.ece,science

Scientists have an answer A new study’s conclusions suggest Venus was never habitable Earth is an ocean world, with water covering about 71% of its surface. Venus, our closest planetary neighbor, is sometimes called Earth’s twin based on their similar size and rocky composition. While its surface is baked and barren today, might Venus once also have been covered by oceans? The answer is no, according to new research that inferred the water content of the planet’s interior - a key indicator for whether or not Venus once had oceans - based on the chemical composition of its atmosphere. The researchers concluded that the planet currently has a substantially dry interior that is consistent with the idea that Venus was left desiccated after the epoch early in its history when its surface was comprised of molten rock - magma - and thereafter has had a parched surface.",https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/science/did-venus-ever-have-oceans-scientists-have-an-answer/article68940988.ece,science

The study has been published in the journal Nature. The analyses of hundreds of samples provide clues about the role dinosaurs played in the ecosystem around 200 million years ago. Fossil records show that dinosaurs evolved during the middle part of the Triassic period (247 to 237 million years ago).

Premium Through mathematical models and by conducting a variety of experiments, researchers have elucidated the key components of the plant’s dispersal strategy The squirting cucumber (Ecballium elaterium) is named for the ballistic method the species uses to disperse its seeds. When ripe, the ovoid-shaped fruits detach from the stem and eject the seeds explosively in a high-pressure jet of mucilage. This projectile launch — lasting just 30 milliseconds — causes the seeds to reach speeds of around 20 metres per second, and land at distances up to 250 times the length of the fruit (around 10 metres). The exact mechanism of the squirting cucumber’s seed dispersal, and how this affects its reproductive success, remained poorly understood. Through mathematical models and by conducting a variety of experiments, including high-speed camera to film the seed dispersal process, measuring fruit and stem volume before and after dispersal, and monitoring the fruit with time-lapse photography in the days leading up to launch, researchers have elucidated the key components of the plant’s dispersal strategy. In the weeks leading up to seed dispersal, the fruits become highly pressurised due to a build-up of mucilaginous fluid.",https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/how-does-the-squirting-cucumber-squirt/article68927528.ece,science

Premium Genome sequencing identified the PB2-E627K mutation in the British Columbia teenager, which is linked to faster replication in human cells and greater severity of illness, and likely emerged during the infection Avian influenza, commonly known as bird flu, is a viral infection primarily affecting birds. A global outbreak of H5N1, a highly pathogenic avian influenza virus, has been spreading across the world since late 2020, driven by a new emerging lineage of the virus — 2.3.4.4b. H5N1 has been a significant concern in global public health due to its potential to cause severe disease in humans and its ability to infect a wide range of hosts, including poultry, wild birds, and mammals. Since its emergence in the late 1990s, the virus has predominantly been an issue for the poultry industry, but sporadic human cases have raised alarms about its pandemic potential. However, recent human cases of H5N1 in British Columbia in Canada and California have increased concerns about the adaptability of the virus and possible mutations that could facilitate human-to-human transmission. In November 2024, a teenager from Fraser Health, British Columbia was diagnosed with H5N1. This is the first domestically acquired case of human H5N1 infection in Canada. The teenager initially experienced conjunctivitis, fever, and cough, which rapidly progressed to acute respiratory distress syndrome, requiring intensive care. Genomic sequencing revealed that the virus belonged to the 2.3.4.4b clade, genotype D1.1, consistent with strains found in wild birds in the Fraser Valley area and not directly related to outbreaks at poultry farms in British Columbia. The D1.1 is a different genotype than the one that has infected dairy workers in the U.S. and the child in California. Testing of household contacts of the patient, pets, nearby animals, and environmental samples returned negative results for influenza H5 and despite several efforts, health officials were not able to identify the definitive source of the teenager’s infection.",https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/emerging-h5n1-mutations-raise-risk-of-human-infections/article68928505.ece,science

Premium No Subtitle Sometimes when a rocket or a jet takes off, its exhaust has an alternating pattern of light and dark patches (see image). The bright patches in this formation are called shock diamonds, a.k.a. Mach diamonds. Shock diamonds are formed when an engine releases its exhaust into the atmosphere at a supersonic speed. Just as it leaves the engine, the exhaust can be at a lower pressure than atmospheric pressure at the same altitude. As the exhaust flows out, the atmosphere compresses it until the two pressures are equal. It’s also possible that the exhaust becomes over-compressed, at which point it will expand outward again to drop its pressure. This seesawing process may repeat itself multiple times until the exhaust pressure is close to the atmospheric pressure.

Premium A recent paper has garnered interest for discovering that white blood cells activated by severe COVID-19 demonstrate cancer-fighting abilities. How does this work? Cancer, often called the “emperor of all maladies,” remains a formidable adversary despite decades of scientific progress. However, research in recent years has brought us closer to unlocking new ways to combat it. A study from Northwestern University in Chicago, published in the November issue of The Journal of Clinical Investigation, has gained attention for discovering that white blood cells activated by severe COVID-19 demonstrate cancer-fighting abilities. Working with laboratory mice, researchers showed that the spread of cancer, also known as metastasis, could be slowed by a specialised type of white blood cell called induced non-classical monocytes (I-NCMs). These cells can be generated through severe infections like COVID-19 or by using certain chemicals. Once activated, I-NCMs are able to leave blood vessels and migrate to tumours, where they launch an attack on cancer cells. COVID-19 is known to cause worse outcomes for older individuals and those weakened by ailments including cancer. However, there are rare reports of cancer going into remission (absence of disease) following COVID-19.",https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/health/using-the-bodys-own-defences-to-fight-cancer-new-research-offers-a-clue-from-covid-19/article68897661.ece,science

"How do ants selectively travel to the food source that is the shortest distance from their nests?
Premium",No Subtitle,The Hindu Bureau,"How do ants selectively travel to the food source that is the shortest distance from their nests?
Premium No Subtitle Researchers have discovered that in a foraging ant’s search for food, it will leave pheromone trails connecting its colony to multiple food sources when they are available, successfully creating the first model that explains the phenomenon of trail formation to multiple food sources. Foraging for resources is an essential process for the daily life of an ant colony, and ants will self-organize using chemical pheromones. Once an ant detects a food source, it secretes a chemical trail to lead other ants to the source. Using computational simulations of ants searching for food, stochastic modeling and a system of partial-differential equations, the researchers also observed that over time, ants will selectively travel to the food source that is the shortest distance from its nest in an environment with multiple sources. “It was so cool to see how equidistant food sources could maintain multiple food trails as an equilibrium. If one food source was just slightly closer to the ants’ nest, the ants would eventually form one singular trail to the closest source,” Florida State University researcher Bhargav Karamched said in a release.

While these fires aren’t solely responsible for Delhi’s plight, a controversy over measuring their prevalence illustrates the amount of attention they’re receiving. Farmers in Punjab and Haryana sow rice in the kharif season and harvest it in November, using the summer monsoons to quench the crop’s high water demand.

Premium No Subtitle Stationary objects experience only the gravitational force. Such objects can be balanced only when the line of action — the line connecting the centre of gravity of the object towards the earth — touches the ground at a point within the base of the object.

Premium",No Subtitle,D. Balasubramanian,"Eye donation and corneal transplant
Premium No Subtitle The International Agency for Prevention of Blindness (IAPB) marks every second Thursday of October, which falls on October 14 this year, as World Sight Day. The aim is to increase awareness and support efforts to ensure everyone across the world can benefit from vision. This includes offering eyeglasses to those who need them, treating the damaged parts of the eye, say, by replacing an opacified lens in the eye (a cataract), or offering corneal transplants to restore vision. Corneal blindness is a major cause of blindness in India. A corneal transplant involves restoring vision to an individual with a damaged cornea by using healthy tissue from a donor. However, many factors impact the long-term success of such grafts: the quality of the donor tissue, the kind of corneal condition, and crucially, long-term follow-up care. The cornea is a thin, clear, dome-shaped tissue layer of the eye that covers the pupil and iris. Corneal tissue is specialised to remain transparent, so that it bends the light inwards towards the retina in the back, which has photo-receptor cells that help us see. If the cornea is damaged due to any reason, it loses this ability to refract and let in light, and a person loses vision. The only means of restoring vision is through corneal transplant.",https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/eye-donation-and-corneal-transplant/article68872500.ece,science

Premium No Subtitle Intermittent fasting has proven benefits for metabolic health, but a new study shows that it could slow hair growth — at least in mice. Researchers report in the Cell that mice subjected to intermittent fasting regimes show improved metabolic health but slower hair regeneration compared to mice with 24/7 access to food. A similar process might occur in humans, based on a small clinical trial that the team also conducted, but it’s likely to be less severe since humans have a much slower metabolic rate and different hair growth patterns compared to mice. In addition to its metabolic benefits, previous studies have shown that fasting can improve the stress resistance of stem cells associated with blood, intestinal, and muscle tissue, but little is known about how it impacts peripheral tissues such as skin and hair.

Fresh corroboration of the perplexing observation that the universe is expanding more rapidly than expected has scientists pondering the cause - perhaps some unknown factor involving the mysterious cosmic components dark energy and dark matter. Two years of data from NASA's James Webb Space Telescope have now validated the Hubble Space Telescope's earlier finding that the rate of the universe's expansion is faster - by about 8% - than would be expected based on what astrophysicists know of the initial conditions in the cosmos and its evolution over billions of years.

Premium Researchers have identified two distinct groups of Indian star tortoises, so simply releasing seized individuals into nearby forests could be unscientific The Indian star tortoise (Geochelone elegans) is a sight to behold, with its obsidian shell and the striking Sun-yellow star patterns adorning it. These tortoises are hardy herbivores and are popular as exotic house pets — but they shouldn’t be. It’s illegal to own one in India but also unethical since they are vulnerable in the wild. Endemic to the subcontinent, Indian star tortoises reside in arid pockets of northwest India (bordering Pakistan), South India, and Sri Lanka. However, members of the species have also been found in people’s homes as far afield as Canada and the U.S. The increasing demand for them as pets has entangled them in one of the largest global wildlife trafficking networks.",https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/energy-and-environment/study-brings-indian-star-tortoise-to-evidence-based-conservation/article68961578.ece,science

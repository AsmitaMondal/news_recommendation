Fresh corroboration of the perplexing observation that the universe is expanding more rapidly than expected has scientists pondering the cause - perhaps some unknown factor involving the mysterious cosmic components dark energy and dark matter. Two years of data from NASA's James Webb Space Telescope have now validated the Hubble Space Telescope's earlier finding that the rate of the universe's expansion is faster - by about 8% - than would be expected based on what astrophysicists know of the initial conditions in the cosmos and its evolution over billions of years.

Premium Researchers have identified two distinct groups of Indian star tortoises, so simply releasing seized individuals into nearby forests could be unscientific The Indian star tortoise (Geochelone elegans) is a sight to behold, with its obsidian shell and the striking Sun-yellow star patterns adorning it. These tortoises are hardy herbivores and are popular as exotic house pets — but they shouldn’t be. It’s illegal to own one in India but also unethical since they are vulnerable in the wild. Endemic to the subcontinent, Indian star tortoises reside in arid pockets of northwest India (bordering Pakistan), South India, and Sri Lanka. However, members of the species have also been found in people’s homes as far afield as Canada and the U.S. The increasing demand for them as pets has entangled them in one of the largest global wildlife trafficking networks.",https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/energy-and-environment/study-brings-indian-star-tortoise-to-evidence-based-conservation/article68961578.ece,science,2

Premium Genetically modified malaria-causing parasites do not cause disease; they instead prime the immune system during the initial stage of their life cycle in the liver Two vaccines against malaria have been rolled out in some countries in Africa. Besides vaccines, scientists have been using genetically altered mosquitoes to stop the spread of malaria. One is the release of radiation-sterilised male mosquitoes to prevent eggs from hatching. Another is engineering mosquitoes that slow the growth of malaria-causing parasites in the gut thereby preventing transmission of malaria to humans. The other method is using genetically modified mosquitoes that can spread resistance to malaria-causing parasites by thriving and mating with wild mosquitoes. Now, in a radical approach, scientists have shifted their focus from genetic modification of malaria-causing mosquitoes to malaria-causing parasites. They have genetically modified malaria-causing parasites so that the parasites do not cause disease. Instead, they prime the immune system during the initial stage of their life cycle in the liver and before they enter the bloodstream. Malaria-causing parasites cause infection and symptoms begin to show only when they move into the bloodstream from the liver stage.",https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/science/preventing-malaria-using-genetically-modified-malaria-parasites/article68955241.ece,science,22

Venus, our closest planetary neighbor, is sometimes called Earth’s twin based on their similar size and rocky composition. While its surface is baked and barren today, might Venus once also have been covered by oceans? The answer is no, according to new research that inferred the water content of the planet’s interior - a key indicator for whether or not Venus once had oceans - based on the chemical composition of its atmosphere. The researchers concluded that the planet currently has a substantially dry interior that is consistent with the idea that Venus was left desiccated after the epoch early in its history when its surface was comprised of molten rock - magma - and thereafter has had a parched surface.",https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/science/did-venus-ever-have-oceans-scientists-have-an-answer/article68940988.ece,science,32

The study has been published in the journal Nature. The analyses of hundreds of samples provide clues about the role dinosaurs played in the ecosystem around 200 million years ago. Fossil records show that dinosaurs evolved during the middle part of the Triassic period (247 to 237 million years ago).

Premium Through mathematical models and by conducting a variety of experiments, researchers have elucidated the key components of the plant’s dispersal strategy The squirting cucumber (Ecballium elaterium) is named for the ballistic method the species uses to disperse its seeds. When ripe, the ovoid-shaped fruits detach from the stem and eject the seeds explosively in a high-pressure jet of mucilage. This projectile launch — lasting just 30 milliseconds — causes the seeds to reach speeds of around 20 metres per second, and land at distances up to 250 times the length of the fruit (around 10 metres). The exact mechanism of the squirting cucumber’s seed dispersal, and how this affects its reproductive success, remained poorly understood. Through mathematical models and by conducting a variety of experiments, including high-speed camera to film the seed dispersal process, measuring fruit and stem volume before and after dispersal, and monitoring the fruit with time-lapse photography in the days leading up to launch, researchers have elucidated the key components of the plant’s dispersal strategy. In the weeks leading up to seed dispersal, the fruits become highly pressurised due to a build-up of mucilaginous fluid.",https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/how-does-the-squirting-cucumber-squirt/article68927528.ece,science,38

Premium Genome sequencing identified the PB2-E627K mutation in the British Columbia teenager, which is linked to faster replication in human cells and greater severity of illness, and likely emerged during the infection Avian influenza, commonly known as bird flu, is a viral infection primarily affecting birds. A global outbreak of H5N1, a highly pathogenic avian influenza virus, has been spreading across the world since late 2020, driven by a new emerging lineage of the virus — 2.3.4.4b. H5N1 has been a significant concern in global public health due to its potential to cause severe disease in humans and its ability to infect a wide range of hosts, including poultry, wild birds, and mammals. Since its emergence in the late 1990s, the virus has predominantly been an issue for the poultry industry, but sporadic human cases have raised alarms about its pandemic potential. However, recent human cases of H5N1 in British Columbia in Canada and California have increased concerns about the adaptability of the virus and possible mutations that could facilitate human-to-human transmission. In November 2024, a teenager from Fraser Health, British Columbia was diagnosed with H5N1. This is the first domestically acquired case of human H5N1 infection in Canada. The teenager initially experienced conjunctivitis, fever, and cough, which rapidly progressed to acute respiratory distress syndrome, requiring intensive care. Genomic sequencing revealed that the virus belonged to the 2.3.4.4b clade, genotype D1.1, consistent with strains found in wild birds in the Fraser Valley area and not directly related to outbreaks at poultry farms in British Columbia. The D1.1 is a different genotype than the one that has infected dairy workers in the U.S. and the child in California. Testing of household contacts of the patient, pets, nearby animals, and environmental samples returned negative results for influenza H5 and despite several efforts, health officials were not able to identify the definitive source of the teenager’s infection.",https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/emerging-h5n1-mutations-raise-risk-of-human-infections/article68928505.ece,science,41

The bright patches in this formation are called shock diamonds, a.k.a. Mach diamonds. Shock diamonds are formed when an engine releases its exhaust into the atmosphere at a supersonic speed. Just as it leaves the engine, the exhaust can be at a lower pressure than atmospheric pressure at the same altitude. As the exhaust flows out, the atmosphere compresses it until the two pressures are equal. It’s also possible that the exhaust becomes over-compressed, at which point it will expand outward again to drop its pressure. This seesawing process may repeat itself multiple times until the exhaust pressure is close to the atmospheric pressure.

Premium A recent paper has garnered interest for discovering that white blood cells activated by severe COVID-19 demonstrate cancer-fighting abilities. How does this work? Cancer, often called the “emperor of all maladies,” remains a formidable adversary despite decades of scientific progress. However, research in recent years has brought us closer to unlocking new ways to combat it. A study from Northwestern University in Chicago, published in the November issue of The Journal of Clinical Investigation, has gained attention for discovering that white blood cells activated by severe COVID-19 demonstrate cancer-fighting abilities. Working with laboratory mice, researchers showed that the spread of cancer, also known as metastasis, could be slowed by a specialised type of white blood cell called induced non-classical monocytes (I-NCMs). These cells can be generated through severe infections like COVID-19 or by using certain chemicals. Once activated, I-NCMs are able to leave blood vessels and migrate to tumours, where they launch an attack on cancer cells. COVID-19 is known to cause worse outcomes for older individuals and those weakened by ailments including cancer. However, there are rare reports of cancer going into remission (absence of disease) following COVID-19.",https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/health/using-the-bodys-own-defences-to-fight-cancer-new-research-offers-a-clue-from-covid-19/article68897661.ece,science,59

"How do ants selectively travel to the food source that is the shortest distance from their nests?
Premium",No Subtitle,The Hindu Bureau,"How do ants selectively travel to the food source that is the shortest distance from their nests?
Premium No Subtitle Researchers have discovered that in a foraging ant’s search for food, it will leave pheromone trails connecting its colony to multiple food sources when they are available, successfully creating the first model that explains the phenomenon of trail formation to multiple food sources. Foraging for resources is an essential process for the daily life of an ant colony, and ants will self-organize using chemical pheromones. Once an ant detects a food source, it secretes a chemical trail to lead other ants to the source. Using computational simulations of ants searching for food, stochastic modeling and a system of partial-differential equations, the researchers also observed that over time, ants will selectively travel to the food source that is the shortest distance from its nest in an environment with multiple sources. “It was so cool to see how equidistant food sources could maintain multiple food trails as an equilibrium. If one food source was just slightly closer to the ants’ nest, the ants would eventually form one singular trail to the closest source,” Florida State University researcher Bhargav Karamched said in a release.

Plants release chemicals into the air when in danger, known as volatile organic compounds (VOCs), which serves as a distress to neighbouring plants to stay alert of the impending threat.

Premium",No Subtitle,D. Balasubramanian,"Eye donation and corneal transplant
Premium No Subtitle The International Agency for Prevention of Blindness (IAPB) marks every second Thursday of October, which falls on October 14 this year, as World Sight Day. The aim is to increase awareness and support efforts to ensure everyone across the world can benefit from vision. This includes offering eyeglasses to those who need them, treating the damaged parts of the eye, say, by replacing an opacified lens in the eye (a cataract), or offering corneal transplants to restore vision. Corneal blindness is a major cause of blindness in India. A corneal transplant involves restoring vision to an individual with a damaged cornea by using healthy tissue from a donor. However, many factors impact the long-term success of such grafts: the quality of the donor tissue, the kind of corneal condition, and crucially, long-term follow-up care. The cornea is a thin, clear, dome-shaped tissue layer of the eye that covers the pupil and iris. Corneal tissue is specialised to remain transparent, so that it bends the light inwards towards the retina in the back, which has photo-receptor cells that help us see. If the cornea is damaged due to any reason, it loses this ability to refract and let in light, and a person loses vision. The only means of restoring vision is through corneal transplant.",https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/eye-donation-and-corneal-transplant/article68872500.ece,science,89

Premium A tailored approach that considers age, lifestyle and skin health is crucial to maintaining resilient skin throughout the cold season Winter presents unique challenges for the skin. As temperatures drop and humidity plummets, the air pulls moisture away from the skin, leaving it dry, flaky, and prone to irritation. For those with preexisting skin conditions like eczema, acne, or psoriasis, winter can aggravate symptoms, making proper care critical. While general advice such as applying moisturisers and avoiding hot showers is helpful, winter skincare demands a more thoughtful and tailored approach that considers age, lifestyle and skin health. The colder months affect skin health primarily through dehydration. The skin’s natural barrier, which retains moisture and protects against environmental irritants, becomes compromised. This breakdown can lead to conditions such as redness, cracks, and increased sensitivity, paving the way for infections or exacerbation of chronic issues.

Among these, memory loss, brain fog and sleep disturbances indicate brain involvement. MRI scans done before and after COVID-19 show shrinkage in certain brain regions, pointing to tissue loss. This raises crucial questions: how does a respiratory virus go on to affect the brain? And what drives brain inflammation in these patients? Two recent papers provide insights into how the virus might indirectly affect the brain.

"Preventing malaria using genetically modified malaria parasites
Premium",Genetically modified malaria-causing parasites do not cause disease; they instead prime the immune system during the initial stage of their life cycle in the liver,R. Prasad,"Preventing malaria using genetically modified malaria parasites
Premium Genetically modified malaria-causing parasites do not cause disease; they instead prime the immune system during the initial stage of their life cycle in the liver Two vaccines against malaria have been rolled out in some countries in Africa. Besides vaccines, scientists have been using genetically altered mosquitoes to stop the spread of malaria. One is the release of radiation-sterilised male mosquitoes to prevent eggs from hatching. Another is engineering mosquitoes that slow the growth of malaria-causing parasites in the gut thereby preventing transmission of malaria to humans. The other method is using genetically modified mosquitoes that can spread resistance to malaria-causing parasites by thriving and mating with wild mosquitoes. Now, in a radical approach, scientists have shifted their focus from genetic modification of malaria-causing mosquitoes to malaria-causing parasites. They have genetically modified malaria-causing parasites so that the parasites do not cause disease. Instead, they prime the immune system during the initial stage of their life cycle in the liver and before they enter the bloodstream. Malaria-causing parasites cause infection and symptoms begin to show only when they move into the bloodstream from the liver stage.",https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/science/preventing-malaria-using-genetically-modified-malaria-parasites/article68955241.ece,health,230

Premium Experts point to a host of factors including less-than-optimal reintegration programmes; pressures on families and the lack of financial outlays to meet the scale of the problem On a rainy September morning in Karjat, on the outskirts of Mumbai, 25 patients from the Regional Mental Hospital (RMH), Yerwada, arrived at the Shraddha Rehabilitation Centre, run by an NGO, to be reunited with their families. Many of these patients had been residents of RMH for over five years; some living there for years, even after being treated and cured. Among the patients was Lukhi, a woman in her 40s, standing in a queue, fiddling with her bangles and waiting to speak to her psychiatrist. All she asked him when her turn came was: “Ghar chod do ge na?” You will let me go home, right? Lukhi was brought to the RMH in 2016 and lived there for eight years even though she was fit to be discharged within a year. It was only on September 10 this year, after the NGO collaborated with the RMH for rehabilitation that the process of reuniting her with her family began. Lukhi’s is not an isolated case.

Premium A study of British Pakistanis and British Bangladeshis has found that South Asian populations have higher genetic risks for producing insufficient insulin, and having fat unfavourably distributed in their body, making them more susceptible to diabetes, and perhaps needing more medication to manage it The fact that South Asians are more susceptible to Type 2 diabetes compared to some other populations has been established now. India is in an especially precarious position when it comes to this non-communicable disease – an estimated 10.13 crore people in the country have diabetes – and faces a huge challenge in screening, management and treatment. But what are the exact genetic pathways that make South Asians more prone to getting diabetes? And can insight into them help with better treatment? A new study by Sam Hodgson et al, ‘Genetic basis of early onset and progression of Type 2 diabetes in South Asians’ published in Nature Medicine, explores this. One of the reasons this study was undertaken, the paper notes, is that genetic research is largely focused on European ancestry groups, meaning the genetic risks of other populations such as South Asians is poorly understood.",https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/health/identifying-the-genetic-pathways-through-which-south-asians-have-a-higher-risk-of-diabetes-and-tailoring-medication/article68954196.ece,health,240

Premium Genome sequencing identified the PB2-E627K mutation in the British Columbia teenager, which is linked to faster replication in human cells and greater severity of illness, and likely emerged during the infection Avian influenza, commonly known as bird flu, is a viral infection primarily affecting birds. A global outbreak of H5N1, a highly pathogenic avian influenza virus, has been spreading across the world since late 2020, driven by a new emerging lineage of the virus — 2.3.4.4b. H5N1 has been a significant concern in global public health due to its potential to cause severe disease in humans and its ability to infect a wide range of hosts, including poultry, wild birds, and mammals. Since its emergence in the late 1990s, the virus has predominantly been an issue for the poultry industry, but sporadic human cases have raised alarms about its pandemic potential. However, recent human cases of H5N1 in British Columbia in Canada and California have increased concerns about the adaptability of the virus and possible mutations that could facilitate human-to-human transmission. In November 2024, a teenager from Fraser Health, British Columbia was diagnosed with H5N1. This is the first domestically acquired case of human H5N1 infection in Canada. The teenager initially experienced conjunctivitis, fever, and cough, which rapidly progressed to acute respiratory distress syndrome, requiring intensive care. Genomic sequencing revealed that the virus belonged to the 2.3.4.4b clade, genotype D1.1, consistent with strains found in wild birds in the Fraser Valley area and not directly related to outbreaks at poultry farms in British Columbia. The D1.1 is a different genotype than the one that has infected dairy workers in the U.S. and the child in California. Testing of household contacts of the patient, pets, nearby animals, and environmental samples returned negative results for influenza H5 and despite several efforts, health officials were not able to identify the definitive source of the teenager’s infection.",https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/emerging-h5n1-mutations-raise-risk-of-human-infections/article68928505.ece,health,256

As this programme evolved, so too did permanent methods of contraception. During 1966-70, about 80.5% of all sterilisation procedures in India were vasectomies. This percentage declined every year due to changing policies that, together with other factors, placed less and less of an emphasis on vasectomies.

Premium The story of biomedical waste management reminds us that progress often emerges from the depths of crisis: the stigma, fear, and tragedy surrounding HIV/AIDS indirectly gave rise to a cleaner, safer healthcare environment In August 1987, the beaches of the United States witnessed a chilling phenomenon dubbed the “Syringe Tide.” Used syringes and other medical waste, such as blood vials and body tissues, began appearing on the Jersey Shore and New York City beaches along the Atlantic coast. The sight of children playing with syringes became a vivid image that spurred a national outcry. The scene, reminiscent of a biological apocalypse, rattled the American public. The disaster was traced back to New York City’s improper waste disposal, dumping hazardous refuse into fresh landfills (now closed). Though hospital waste has always been unpleasant, its hazardous potential was grossly underestimated. This incident unfolded in the shadow of the AIDS epidemic as a mounting crisis. Just four years earlier, in 1983, two scientists, Luc Montagnier from France and Robert Gallo from the United States, had independently identified the virus responsible for AIDS. By the mid-1980s, HIV/AIDS was viewed as a biological death sentence, with little hope for a cure or vaccine. The virus’s primary target is immune cells, and medical intervention was extraordinarily challenging then. The epidemic rapidly became a symbol of fear, ignorance, and stigma.",https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/health/stigma-of-hiv-and-birth-of-biomedical-waste-regulations-a-story-of-tragedy-and-reform/article68908394.ece,health,280

"An ideal way to treat India’s corneal blindness problem
Premium",A ‘consent-driven donation’ approach is a step that can eliminate avoidable corneal vision loss,"Tejah Balantrapu,","An ideal way to treat India’s corneal blindness problem
Premium A ‘consent-driven donation’ approach is a step that can eliminate avoidable corneal vision loss Despite strong support for eye donation in India, with millions, including popular film actors, pledging to donate, an acute shortage of corneas persists. There is a need to perform about 1,00,000 corneal transplants every year, but only 30% of this need is being met. On the demand side, many fellow citizens lead a lifetime of avoidable sight loss, waiting for sight-restoring tissue. The solution on the supply side are the millions dying in Indian hospitals every day who are eligible to donate their tissues — but do not. What if we ‘presume consent’ and treat them all as cornea donors? News reports note that, indeed, a ‘presumed consent’ amendment to the Transplantation of Human Organs and Tissues Act (THOTA), 1994, is in the works to allow cornea retrieval from all eligible deaths in hospitals. Indian policymakers are seriously considering the ‘presumed consent’ approach to corneal donations because of the scale of the problem. The cornea is the thin, clear outer layer of the eye. Infection, accidents, or congenital conditions can turn it opaque. Corneal opacities are the second major cause of blindness in India among those who are 50 years and older, and the primary cause in those younger. An estimated 1.2 million people live with corneal opacities in India and about a third can be treated with a corneal transplant. These numbers make India one of the largest populations with corneal blindness in the world. However, most corneal blindness is preventable or treatable. For those eligible for treatment, corneal transplant surgery is an effective intervention. In fact, it is the most frequently performed transplant in the world. Critical to enabling corneal transplants is an ‘eye bank’, which handles ethically sourced corneas, processes them, and makes them available to eye surgeons. India does not have enough eye banks of the necessary standard, nor does it have enough corneal surgeons. Along with procuring corneas, it is estimated that there is a need for 50 high-functioning eye banks (there are about 12 to 14 today) and 500 active corneal surgeons performing 200 transplants on average every year. With appropriate legislation enabling this approach, the target of 1,00,000 corneal transplants a year can be reached.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/op-ed/an-ideal-way-to-treat-indias-corneal-blindness-problem/article68913949.ece,health,294

Why are doctors concerned about the number of diabetics in India? What steps need to be taken? The story so far: On International Diabetes Day (November 14), a paper published in The Lancet, based on a global study, recorded over 800 million adults living with diabetes, with more than half not receiving treatment. According to the study, the total number of adults living with either Type 1 or Type 2 diabetes in the world has surpassed 800 million — over four times the total number in 1990. Of this, over a quarter (212 million) live in India, with another 148 million in China. The estimate came as a bit of a shock, because the last scientific countrywide estimate by the Indian Council of Medical Research-INDIAB study last year had pegged the number at slightly over 100 million. The nub of it is in the means used to measure blood sugar, experts have pointed out. The Lancet study, conducted by the NCD Risk Factor Collaboration (NCD-RisC), along with the World Health Organization (WHO), used data from over 140 million people (18+ years) culled from more than 1,000 studies in different countries.

Premium A recent paper has garnered interest for discovering that white blood cells activated by severe COVID-19 demonstrate cancer-fighting abilities. How does this work? Cancer, often called the “emperor of all maladies,” remains a formidable adversary despite decades of scientific progress. However, research in recent years has brought us closer to unlocking new ways to combat it. A study from Northwestern University in Chicago, published in the November issue of The Journal of Clinical Investigation, has gained attention for discovering that white blood cells activated by severe COVID-19 demonstrate cancer-fighting abilities. Working with laboratory mice, researchers showed that the spread of cancer, also known as metastasis, could be slowed by a specialised type of white blood cell called induced non-classical monocytes (I-NCMs). These cells can be generated through severe infections like COVID-19 or by using certain chemicals. Once activated, I-NCMs are able to leave blood vessels and migrate to tumours, where they launch an attack on cancer cells. COVID-19 is known to cause worse outcomes for older individuals and those weakened by ailments including cancer. However, there are rare reports of cancer going into remission (absence of disease) following COVID-19.",https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/health/using-the-bodys-own-defences-to-fight-cancer-new-research-offers-a-clue-from-covid-19/article68897661.ece,health,300

Premium The study demonstrates that H5N1 2.3.4.4b clade infection in lactating ferrets leads to mastitis-related disease and transmission to suckling pups, resulting in 100% mortality among the pups During 2020, the highly pathogenic avian influenza A(H5N1) virus of clade 2.3.4.4b emerged and rapidly spread across many parts of Africa, Asia, and Europe. In 2021-2022, the 2.3.4.4b clade of H5N1 first spread to North America and then to South America where it caused large-scale mortality of seabirds. Except for causing episodic mortality of pinnipeds and cetaceans in Europe and North America, the virus had not spread to marine mammals. But that changed when the virus spread along the coast of Peru and Chile in 2022-2023 infecting and killing 30,000 sea lions; the virus also spread to dolphins, otters, and other marine mammals. In Argentina, the virus spread to and killed over 17,000 elephant seals, including almost 97% of the pups.

The HPV immunisation programme began in Scotland in 2008. Women who were vaccinated with three doses of a bivalent HPV vaccine at 14 to 22 years of age as part of a catch-up programme (2008-2011) had a significant reduction — (3.2 cases per 100 000 population) — in cervical cancer incidence compared with unvaccinated women. The study published in the Journal of the National Cancer Institute found that routine immunisation with a bivalent HPV vaccine when girls are 12 to 13 years of age is highly effective in preventing invasive cervical cancer. In the case of teenagers aged 14 to 18 years, HPV vaccination with three doses led to significant reduction in the incidence of invasive cancer. “This study showed a greater risk reduction than predicted for girls vaccinated at age 12 or 13 years because no cases of invasive cancer have yet been diagnosed in this age group,” the authors write.",https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/scotland-zero-cervical-cancer-cases-among-women-vaccinated-early/article68898697.ece,health,306

Despite the success of the procedure, no journal was prepared to publish the results before Vaccines finally accepted the paper.

Premium A tailored approach that considers age, lifestyle and skin health is crucial to maintaining resilient skin throughout the cold season Winter presents unique challenges for the skin. As temperatures drop and humidity plummets, the air pulls moisture away from the skin, leaving it dry, flaky, and prone to irritation. For those with preexisting skin conditions like eczema, acne, or psoriasis, winter can aggravate symptoms, making proper care critical. While general advice such as applying moisturisers and avoiding hot showers is helpful, winter skincare demands a more thoughtful and tailored approach that considers age, lifestyle and skin health. The colder months affect skin health primarily through dehydration. The skin’s natural barrier, which retains moisture and protects against environmental irritants, becomes compromised.

"New insights into how Long COVID affects the brain
Premium",No Subtitle,Rajeev  Jayadevan,"New insights into how Long COVID affects the brain
Premium No Subtitle Long COVID is a condition marked by multiple persistent symptoms that sometimes occur even after mild infections. Among these, memory loss, brain fog and sleep disturbances indicate brain involvement. MRI scans done before and after COVID-19 show shrinkage in certain brain regions, pointing to tissue loss. This raises crucial questions: how does a respiratory virus go on to affect the brain? And what drives brain inflammation in these patients? Two recent papers provide insights into how the virus might indirectly affect the brain. A study published in Cell Host & Microbe concludes that continued presence of the virus spike protein could be triggering inflammation and neurodegenerative changes in the brain. The spike also activates inflammatory pathways. When researchers injected spike protein into the skulls of mice, they observed brain inflammation along with behavioural changes.",https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/science/new-insights-into-how-long-covid-affects-the-brain/article68955259.ece,health,427
"Preventing malaria using genetically modified malaria parasites
Premium",Genetically modified malaria-causing parasites do not cause disease; they instead prime the immune system during the initial stage of their life cycle in the liver,R. Prasad,"Preventing malaria using genetically modified malaria parasites
Premium Genetically modified malaria-causing parasites do not cause disease; they instead prime the immune system during the initial stage of their life cycle in the liver Two vaccines against malaria have been rolled out in some countries in Africa. Besides vaccines, scientists have been using genetically altered mosquitoes to stop the spread of malaria. One is the release of radiation-sterilised male mosquitoes to prevent eggs from hatching. Another is engineering mosquitoes that slow the growth of malaria-causing parasites in the gut thereby preventing transmission of malaria to humans. The other method is using genetically modified mosquitoes that can spread resistance to malaria-causing parasites by thriving and mating with wild mosquitoes. Now, in a radical approach, scientists have shifted their focus from genetic modification of malaria-causing mosquitoes to malaria-causing parasites. They have genetically modified malaria-causing parasites so that the parasites do not cause disease. Instead, they prime the immune system during the initial stage of their life cycle in the liver and before they enter the bloodstream. Malaria-causing parasites cause infection and symptoms begin to show only when they move into the bloodstream from the liver stage.",https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/science/preventing-malaria-using-genetically-modified-malaria-parasites/article68955241.ece,health,428

"Twelve days that shook Syria
Premium",The rapid collapse of government forces in Aleppo stunned both the militants and the regime alike,Stanly Johny,"Twelve days that shook Syria
Premium The rapid collapse of government forces in Aleppo stunned both the militants and the regime alike The Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS), the Syrian Islamist militant group, had been preparing for months for a large-scale offensive against regime forces. The civil war was quiet for years, particularly after the regime of President Bashar al-Assad captured most of its lost territories — including Aleppo, Hama and Homs. The HTS, formerly al-Nusra Front, the Syrian arm of al-Qaeda, had built a statelet in Idlib, in northwestern Syria, under the leadership of its ‘emir’, Abu Muhammed al-Jolani. The HTS and its ally Syrian National Army (SNA), formerly the Free Syrian Army, had informed Turkiye, their patron, at least six months ago about the offensive plan, according to a Reuters report. And Ankara had given its tacit approval. Mr. Assad’s troops were in a bad shape. Soldiers were poorly paid and lacked motivation. The country never recovered from the scars of the civil war. Under crippling American sanctions, its finances were in shambles. During the peak of the civil war, in 2015-16, Mr. Assad had heavily relied on his external allies for security — Russia, Iran and Hezbollah. Now, the situation was different. The Russians were focused on Ukraine. Iran lost a host of its Syria commanders to Israeli strikes. Hezbollah had been weakened in a year-long war with Israel. The HTS launched its offensive on November 27, the day Israel and Lebanon signed a ceasefire. On the 12th day, the Assad regime fell, sending tremors across the region.",https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/twelve-days-that-shook-syria/article68969014.ece,international,699

"What is the delay in forming a government in Austria? | Explained
Premium",Why are Austria’s mainstream parties refusing to enter into a coalition with the far-right Freedom Party? Why did the Austrian President refuse to invite the FPO to lead the country?,Garimella Subramaniam,"What is the delay in forming a government in Austria? | Explained
Premium Why are Austria’s mainstream parties refusing to enter into a coalition with the far-right Freedom Party? Why did the Austrian President refuse to invite the FPO to lead the country? The story so far: The Austrian chancellor Karl Nehammer’s ruling People’s Party (OVP) has inched closer to heading Vienna’s next coalition government. The party was the runner-up in the September 29 elections and its vote slump, compared with the 2019 polls, was the biggest loss any ruling party has sustained. The OVP’s prospective coalition partner, the Social Democrats (SPO) put up their worst ever electoral showing since World War II. Conversely, the far-right, xenophobic, Eurosceptic, anti-Muslim and pro-Russian Freedom Party (FPO), emerged the largest entity, albeit without a majority. All of Austria’s mainstream parties have refused to form a government with the FPO. The only ground the ultra-right party has gained since the polls is the election of one of its members as the parliament’s speaker. Among the reasons for parties’ antipathy towards the FPO are the latter’s backing for Russia in its full-scale aggression against Ukraine. The FPO has veered further to the extreme right under its current leader Herbert Kickl, who styles himself as the ‘people’s chancellor,’ in a not so oblique reference to Adolf Hitler, and regards Hungary’s autocratic President Viktor Orban as his role model. As interior minister in the short-lived 2017-2019 OVP-FPO coalition government, Mr. Kickl shut down mosques in a crackdown against the “Islamisation” of Austria. His infamous raids on the nation’s intelligence services severely compromised collaboration with international agencies. He continues to advocate for the re-migration of citizens of foreign origin as part of the mission to create a homogenous Austrian society.",https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/what-is-the-delay-in-forming-a-government-in-austria-explained/article68962856.ece,international,728

Premium The man picked by Islamic State leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi to establish a branch in Syria is now leading the country’s most potent militant organisation that has made dramatic territorial advances in recent weeks “We deputised al-Jolani, who is one of our soldiers, with a group of our sons, and pushed them from Iraq to Syria to meet with our cells in Syria and set for them the plans and drew for them the policy of work,” Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, the then-chief of the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS) announced on April 2, 2014, referring to al-Qaeda’s Syria arm, Jabhat al-Nusra. Abu Muhammad al-Jolani, a Saudi-born Syrian jihadist was a lieutenant of Baghdadi. It was Jolani he turned to when he decided to expand his jihadist network into Syria, where a civil war broke out in 2011. “We supplied them with half of what is in the treasury every month, and supplied them with men who had battlefield experience from among the muhajirun [“emigrants”; foreign fighters] and ansar [“supporters”; local jihadists], so they did well next to their brothers from the ardent sons of Syria,” said Baghdadi, taking credit for the creation of a-Nusra. Baghdadi was killed in an American airstrike in Syria in October 2019. The ‘caliphate’ he built, which at its peak had spread from eastern Syria’s Deir Ezzor to Iraq’s Mosul, was destroyed. The Islamic State, the jihadist organisation Baghdadi created and led, has been scattered and weakened ever since. But Jolani, the man Baghdadi chose to lead his network in Syria, is today the leader of Syria’s armed insurgency. He is the ‘emir’ of the ‘Syrian Salvation Government’, which is based in the northwestern province of Idlib, and the leader of Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS), the main opposition jihadist group. In the last week of November, when the whole region’s focus was on a ceasefire deal between Israel and Hezbollah, Jolani’s jihadists launched a surprise attack on Syrian forces from Idlib. Before most people understood what was actually happening, the HTS captured Aleppo, Syria’s second-largest city.",https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/abu-muhammad-al-jolani-syrias-jihadist-in-chief/article68959633.ece,international,767

Premium How much plastic waste is produced now? What is the most common type of plastic waste found in the environment? Why are several countries averse to tackling plastic pollution? Why did talks fail at Busan? Is another round of negotiations likely? The story so far:The 5th Intergovernmental Negotiating Committee (INC-5) on plastic pollution was a conclave of delegations from about 170 countries mandated to establish a legally binding treaty to end plastic pollution, informally called the Global Plastics Treaty. Despite a week of meetings, the INC-5 failed to meet its mandate. The United Nations Environment Assembly (UNEA) resolved in March 2022 to ‘end plastic pollution, including in the marine environment.’ To that end, INC committees were constituted and tasked with negotiating a treaty before the end of 2024. Over the last two years, countries met five times, and attempted to bridge divergent views on how to end plastic pollution. Several countries are enthusiastic about ways and means to encourage recycling and prohibit certain plastics that lead to littering — India for instance has banned single-use plastic since 2022 — but many of them are reluctant to limit plastic production. Several countries are either petro-states or those that have significant industries that manufacture plastic polymers. Before the latest, and what was expected to be the last round of negotiations, began in Busan, South Korea, the Chair of the INC-5, Luis Vayas Valdivieso, circulated a draft text called a ‘non paper.’ This was roughly a synthesis of the views of all countries on managing plastic production but in the end, it turned out that despite long negotiations, the chasm between countries who viewed addressing plastic pollution as a waste management problem, and those that saw it as unachievable without cutting its production at source, was one that was too wide to bridge.",https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/energy-and-environment/why-cant-the-world-agree-on-a-plastic-ban/article68959805.ece,international,774

Premium The Indian origin Republican, who once vowed to ‘shut down the FBI’, has been picked by Donald Trump to lead the Bureau Part three of the children’s book, The Plot Against the King, written by Kash Patel, President-elect Donald Trump’s nominee for Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), talks about the “MAGA king” and his quest to “take down Comma-la-la-la and reclaim his throne”. One can safely assume that the ‘king’ here is Mr. Trump and ‘Comma-la-la-la’, the incumbent U.S. Vice-President Kamala Harris. This also gives us an idea of what Mr. Patel, who owns a charitable foundation called Fight with Kash which among other things funds defamation lawsuits, and a clothing line which sells a variety of merchandise with his logo ‘K$H’, stands for — unabashedly brazen and unapologetically loyal to the incoming U.S. President. Mr. Patel, who was born in 1980 to Indian immigrant parents (who first moved to Canada from East Africa in the 1970s and then to the U.S.) started his career as a public defender in the State of Florida, following which he joined the U.S. Justice Department as a counter-terrorism prosecutor. A member of the Republican party, he was then appointed to the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence (HPSCI) in 2017. He worked as senior aide to Devin Nunes, the chair of the HPSCI and a staunch Trump supporter. Mr. Patel rose up the ranks within Mr. Trump’s inner circle when he scathingly criticised the FBI’s investigation into alleged Russian interference in the 2016 U.S. Presidential election. He, along with Mr. Nunes, authored the ‘Nunes memo’ which accused the FBI of being politically motivated in its investigation.

Premium The rapid collapse of government forces in Aleppo stunned both the militants and the regime alike The Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS), the Syrian Islamist militant group, had been preparing for months for a large-scale offensive against regime forces. The civil war was quiet for years, particularly after the regime of President Bashar al-Assad captured most of its lost territories — including Aleppo, Hama and Homs. The HTS, formerly al-Nusra Front, the Syrian arm of al-Qaeda, had built a statelet in Idlib, in northwestern Syria, under the leadership of its ‘emir’, Abu Muhammed al-Jolani. The HTS and its ally Syrian National Army (SNA), formerly the Free Syrian Army, had informed Turkiye, their patron, at least six months ago about the offensive plan, according to a Reuters report. And Ankara had given its tacit approval. Mr. Assad’s troops were in a bad shape. Soldiers were poorly paid and lacked motivation. The country never recovered from the scars of the civil war. Under crippling American sanctions, its finances were in shambles. During the peak of the civil war, in 2015-16, Mr. Assad had heavily relied on his external allies for security — Russia, Iran and Hezbollah. Now, the situation was different. The Russians were focused on Ukraine. Iran lost a host of its Syria commanders to Israeli strikes. Hezbollah had been weakened in a year-long war with Israel. The HTS launched its offensive on November 27, the day Israel and Lebanon signed a ceasefire. On the 12th day, the Assad regime fell, sending tremors across the region.",https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/twelve-days-that-shook-syria/article68969014.ece,international,816

The civil war was quiet for years, particularly after the regime of President Bashar al-Assad captured most of its lost territories — including Aleppo, Hama and Homs. The HTS, formerly al-Nusra Front, the Syrian arm of al-Qaeda, had built a statelet in Idlib, in northwestern Syria, under the leadership of its ‘emir’, Abu Muhammed al-Jolani.

And Ankara had given its tacit approval. Mr. Assad’s troops were in a bad shape. Soldiers were poorly paid and lacked motivation. The country never recovered from the scars of the civil war. Under crippling American sanctions, its finances were in shambles. During the peak of the civil war, in 2015-16, Mr. Assad had heavily relied on his external allies for security — Russia, Iran and Hezbollah. Now, the situation was different. The Russians were focused on Ukraine. Iran lost a host of its Syria commanders to Israeli strikes. Hezbollah had been weakened in a year-long war with Israel.

Premium",The rapid collapse of government forces in Aleppo stunned both the militants and the regime alike,Stanly Johny,"Twelve days that shook Syria
Premium The rapid collapse of government forces in Aleppo stunned both the militants and the regime alike The Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS), the Syrian Islamist militant group, had been preparing for months for a large-scale offensive against regime forces. The civil war was quiet for years, particularly after the regime of President Bashar al-Assad captured most of its lost territories — including Aleppo, Hama and Homs. The HTS, formerly al-Nusra Front, the Syrian arm of al-Qaeda, had built a statelet in Idlib, in northwestern Syria, under the leadership of its ‘emir’, Abu Muhammed al-Jolani. The HTS and its ally Syrian National Army (SNA), formerly the Free Syrian Army, had informed Turkiye, their patron, at least six months ago about the offensive plan, according to a Reuters report. And Ankara had given its tacit approval. Mr. Assad’s troops were in a bad shape. Soldiers were poorly paid and lacked motivation. The country never recovered from the scars of the civil war. Under crippling American sanctions, its finances were in shambles. During the peak of the civil war, in 2015-16, Mr. Assad had heavily relied on his external allies for security — Russia, Iran and Hezbollah. Now, the situation was different. The Russians were focused on Ukraine. Iran lost a host of its Syria commanders to Israeli strikes. Hezbollah had been weakened in a year-long war with Israel. The HTS launched its offensive on November 27, the day Israel and Lebanon signed a ceasefire.

"Twelve days that shook Syria
Premium",The rapid collapse of government forces in Aleppo stunned both the militants and the regime alike,Stanly Johny,"Twelve days that shook Syria
Premium The rapid collapse of government forces in Aleppo stunned both the militants and the regime alike The Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS), the Syrian Islamist militant group, had been preparing for months for a large-scale offensive against regime forces. The civil war was quiet for years, particularly after the regime of President Bashar al-Assad captured most of its lost territories — including Aleppo, Hama and Homs. The HTS, formerly al-Nusra Front, the Syrian arm of al-Qaeda, had built a statelet in Idlib, in northwestern Syria, under the leadership of its ‘emir’, Abu Muhammed al-Jolani. The HTS and its ally Syrian National Army (SNA), formerly the Free Syrian Army, had informed Turkiye, their patron, at least six months ago about the offensive plan, according to a Reuters report. And Ankara had given its tacit approval. Mr. Assad’s troops were in a bad shape. Soldiers were poorly paid and lacked motivation. The country never recovered from the scars of the civil war. Under crippling American sanctions, its finances were in shambles. During the peak of the civil war, in 2015-16, Mr. Assad had heavily relied on his external allies for security — Russia, Iran and Hezbollah. Now, the situation was different. The Russians were focused on Ukraine. Iran lost a host of its Syria commanders to Israeli strikes. Hezbollah had been weakened in a year-long war with Israel. The HTS launched its offensive on November 27, the day Israel and Lebanon signed a ceasefire. On the 12th day, the Assad regime fell, sending tremors across the region.",https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/twelve-days-that-shook-syria/article68969014.ece,international,881

"Twelve days that shook Syria
Premium",The rapid collapse of government forces in Aleppo stunned both the militants and the regime alike,Stanly Johny,"Twelve days that shook Syria
Premium The rapid collapse of government forces in Aleppo stunned both the militants and the regime alike The Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS), the Syrian Islamist militant group, had been preparing for months for a large-scale offensive against regime forces. The civil war was quiet for years, particularly after the regime of President Bashar al-Assad captured most of its lost territories — including Aleppo, Hama and Homs. The HTS, formerly al-Nusra Front, the Syrian arm of al-Qaeda, had built a statelet in Idlib, in northwestern Syria, under the leadership of its ‘emir’, Abu Muhammed al-Jolani. The HTS and its ally Syrian National Army (SNA), formerly the Free Syrian Army, had informed Turkiye, their patron, at least six months ago about the offensive plan, according to a Reuters report. And Ankara had given its tacit approval. Mr. Assad’s troops were in a bad shape. Soldiers were poorly paid and lacked motivation. The country never recovered from the scars of the civil war. Under crippling American sanctions, its finances were in shambles. During the peak of the civil war, in 2015-16, Mr. Assad had heavily relied on his external allies for security — Russia, Iran and Hezbollah. Now, the situation was different. The Russians were focused on Ukraine. Iran lost a host of its Syria commanders to Israeli strikes. Hezbollah had been weakened in a year-long war with Israel. The HTS launched its offensive on November 27, the day Israel and Lebanon signed a ceasefire. On the 12th day, the Assad regime fell, sending tremors across the region.",https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/twelve-days-that-shook-syria/article68969014.ece,international,907

Premium The rapid collapse of government forces in Aleppo stunned both the militants and the regime alike The Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS), the Syrian Islamist militant group, had been preparing for months for a large-scale offensive against regime forces. The civil war was quiet for years, particularly after the regime of President Bashar al-Assad captured most of its lost territories — including Aleppo, Hama and Homs. The HTS, formerly al-Nusra Front, the Syrian arm of al-Qaeda, had built a statelet in Idlib, in northwestern Syria, under the leadership of its ‘emir’, Abu Muhammed al-Jolani. The HTS and its ally Syrian National Army (SNA), formerly the Free Syrian Army, had informed Turkiye, their patron, at least six months ago about the offensive plan, according to a Reuters report. And Ankara had given its tacit approval. Mr. Assad’s troops were in a bad shape. Soldiers were poorly paid and lacked motivation. The country never recovered from the scars of the civil war. Under crippling American sanctions, its finances were in shambles. During the peak of the civil war, in 2015-16, Mr. Assad had heavily relied on his external allies for security — Russia, Iran and Hezbollah. Now, the situation was different. The Russians were focused on Ukraine. Iran lost a host of its Syria commanders to Israeli strikes. Hezbollah had been weakened in a year-long war with Israel. The HTS launched its offensive on November 27, the day Israel and Lebanon signed a ceasefire.

Big-star filmmaking is now plagued by a lack of know-how in building IPs for the long run, and the trend of splitting the story of one film into two for the sake of a sequel A two-film-strong, 340-minute-long cat-and-mouse game comes to an end in director Sukumar’s Pushpa 2: The Rule. A climactic scene ambiguously ends the arc, urging audiences to ready themselves to leave, only to be compelled back to their seats for 40 more minutes. The extended climax of the Allu Arjun-starrer, meant as a segue to a third Pushpa film, is an excruciatingly tedious episode that leaves you with a poor aftertaste — it’s a cold shower moment in this otherwise ‘wildfire’ of a film. This is a new fad picked up by commercial filmmakers of the pan-India movement — franchising, for better monetisation or to secure a working formula for the future. Most big-ticket films these days either end with a cliffhanger, depriving audiences of the satisfaction of a complete product, or add a surprise climactic cameo to end on a high note and make way for a sequel. Suriya’s Kanguvawas undoubtedly an untested attempt in Tamil, but the makers were quick to jump on this bandwagon, with a surprise cameo by Karthi and a hook to keep us waiting for the second part.

Born to be the perfect prototype, Hildegart turns out to be a prodigy; a child political activist, who, even before turning a teen, gave conferences on feminism and female sexuality.

Critical measures: should film reviews on social media platforms be banned?,"In a post-internet world, the know-how of film criticism is scattered but accessible, and the growing passion for movies has enabled audiences to read films more sensibly. Therefore, a gag order on a platform censors every voice, good or bad",Bhuvanesh Chandar,"Critical measures: should film reviews on social media platforms be banned? In a post-internet world, the know-how of film criticism is scattered but accessible, and the growing passion for movies has enabled audiences to read films more sensibly. Therefore, a gag order on a platform censors every voice, good or bad Earlier this week, the Tamil Film Active Producers Association (TFAPA) filed a writ petition in the Madras High Court, seeking a ban on movie reviews on social media for the first three days of release. The counsel representing the TFAPA listed three reasons that necessitated the request — review bombing through reviews shot in cinema theatres, stage-managing fake reviews by purchasing bulk tickets, and intentionally propagating a negative image of the film through fake social media accounts. These are pivotal concerns that need redressal and creators must be protected from targeted harassment. Paid reviews are real and, as Taapsee Pannu recently quoted Shah Rukh Khan as saying, are nothing more than advertisement spaces for sale. And so when the said space is used to unfairly demean a film, a business, or an entity, the legislature needs to step in and protect the affected parties. However, concerns also arise about the apparent discrepancies in how film chambers navigate these issues; like the ambiguity in using terms like ‘reviewers,’; the irony in how YouTube reviews are used when favourable and flattering; and who is referred to as a ‘reviewer’.",https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/critical-measures-should-film-reviews-on-social-media-platforms-be-banned/article68950810.ece,movies,1003

‘Agni’ movie review: Pratik Gandhi blazes a trail in this tale of courage under fire,"Filled with warm and chilling moments, Rahul Dholakia’s social thriller provides firefighters with their moment under the sun",Anuj Kumar,"‘Agni’ movie review: Pratik Gandhi blazes a trail in this tale of courage under fire Filled with warm and chilling moments, Rahul Dholakia’s social thriller provides firefighters with their moment under the sun In Indian tradition, fire alludes to love and conflict, devotion and anger, eternality and death. The ever-youthful element that demands sacrifice plays the central character in director Rahul Dholakia’s ode to the unstinting spirit of the firefighters. Capturing a daze’s multiple faces and colours, Dholakia removes the smokescreen that covers the firefighters’ work and opens a window into the lives of those who keep us out of its fury but whose services are not duly acknowledged by the system and society. The action takes us into the heart of the evacuation process, the drama unravels the sacrifices firefighters make and the thriller elements seek to find the answer to the source of the firestorm.

Written by Kang Full who made 2023’s complex and expansive superhero K-Drama Moving, Light Shop has also been adapted from his webtoon of the same name.

Big-star filmmaking is now plagued by a lack of know-how in building IPs for the long run, and the trend of splitting the story of one film into two for the sake of a sequel A two-film-strong, 340-minute-long cat-and-mouse game comes to an end in director Sukumar’s Pushpa 2: The Rule. A climactic scene ambiguously ends the arc, urging audiences to ready themselves to leave, only to be compelled back to their seats for 40 more minutes. The extended climax of the Allu Arjun-starrer, meant as a segue to a third Pushpa film, is an excruciatingly tedious episode that leaves you with a poor aftertaste — it’s a cold shower moment in this otherwise ‘wildfire’ of a film. This is a new fad picked up by commercial filmmakers of the pan-India movement — franchising, for better monetisation or to secure a working formula for the future. Most big-ticket films these days either end with a cliffhanger, depriving audiences of the satisfaction of a complete product, or add a surprise climactic cameo to end on a high note and make way for a sequel. Suriya’s Kanguvawas undoubtedly an untested attempt in Tamil, but the makers were quick to jump on this bandwagon, with a surprise cameo by Karthi and a hook to keep us waiting for the second part.

Premium","A look at the claim made in the Economic Survey (2023-24), of India having decoupled its economic growth from greenhouse gas emissions","Badri Narayanan  Gopalakrishnan,","The issue of India’s economic growth versus emissions
Premium A look at the claim made in the Economic Survey (2023-24), of India having decoupled its economic growth from greenhouse gas emissions The Indian economy has consistently showcased its robust growth over the past few decades. But higher economic growth is believed to have come with increasing environmental pressure, notably through higher greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. However, India’s Economic Survey (2023-24) claims that India has decoupled its economic growth from GHG emissions, as between 2005 and 2019, India’s GDP grew at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 7%, while emissions rose at a CAGR of just 4%. This raises a crucial question: has India really decoupled its economic growth from GHG emissions? And, what does this mean for sustainable development? Decoupling refers to breaking the link between economic growth and environmental degradation. Historically, economic growth is found to be positively related with environmental degradation, as this growth is believed to be a driver of GHG emissions. However, with the growing climate crisis, the imperative to reduce emissions while ensuring continued economic growth has gained global traction.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/op-ed/the-issue-of-indias-economic-growth-versus-emissions/article68962376.ece,business,1248

Premium Billionaire Warren Buffet has given away an amount of almost 52 billion dollars to various charities. While such a move is no doubt commendable, one must also question the processes generating the concentration of such wealth in the first place, regardless of whether it is to be used for philanthropy or not Billionaire Warren Buffet, with a net worth of almost $121 billion by some estimates, has maintained his pledge of giving away his wealth. In a recent message to shareholders of Berkshire Hathaway, he has mentioned a transfer of his wealth to foundations overseen by his children, a total amount of around 870 million dollars. In all, it is estimated that he has given away an amount of $52 billion. Mr. Buffet’s recent message has captured the attention of mainstream discourse as it has outlined his social philosophy with regard to wealth and its place in society. Mr. Buffet believes that wealth should be used to equalise opportunities, that the luck that favoured certain individuals and helped them get rich should be extended after one’s death in order to help those less fortunate. While it is not wrong to amass and accumulate wealth during one’s lifetime, allowing it to build across generations is a problem for society. While it is no doubt commendable that Mr. Buffet wishes to give away his fortune, one must also question the processes generating the concentration of such wealth in the first place, regardless of whether it is to be used for philanthropy or not. Inequality is not a question of luck, but of specific policy institutions determined by society. In a world of spiralling inequality, both private philanthropy and the problems it tries to solve are two sides of the same coin, emerging from the very same set of social processes.",https://www.thehindu.com/business/Economy/the-place-of-charity-in-an-unequal-society/article68962838.ece,business,1260

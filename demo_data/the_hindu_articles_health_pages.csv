Premium A tailored approach that considers age, lifestyle and skin health is crucial to maintaining resilient skin throughout the cold season Winter presents unique challenges for the skin. As temperatures drop and humidity plummets, the air pulls moisture away from the skin, leaving it dry, flaky, and prone to irritation. For those with preexisting skin conditions like eczema, acne, or psoriasis, winter can aggravate symptoms, making proper care critical. While general advice such as applying moisturisers and avoiding hot showers is helpful, winter skincare demands a more thoughtful and tailored approach that considers age, lifestyle and skin health. The colder months affect skin health primarily through dehydration. The skin’s natural barrier, which retains moisture and protects against environmental irritants, becomes compromised. This breakdown can lead to conditions such as redness, cracks, and increased sensitivity, paving the way for infections or exacerbation of chronic issues. Understanding these mechanisms is key to building a sustainable and effective routine that ensures skin health throughout the season.",https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/health/winter-skincare-a-practical-guide-to-healthy-skin-for-all-ages/article68954923.ece,health

"New insights into how Long COVID affects the brain
Premium",No Subtitle,Rajeev  Jayadevan,"New insights into how Long COVID affects the brain
Premium No Subtitle Long COVID is a condition marked by multiple persistent symptoms that sometimes occur even after mild infections. Among these, memory loss, brain fog and sleep disturbances indicate brain involvement. MRI scans done before and after COVID-19 show shrinkage in certain brain regions, pointing to tissue loss. This raises crucial questions: how does a respiratory virus go on to affect the brain? And what drives brain inflammation in these patients? Two recent papers provide insights into how the virus might indirectly affect the brain. A study published in Cell Host & Microbe concludes that continued presence of the virus spike protein could be triggering inflammation and neurodegenerative changes in the brain. The spike also activates inflammatory pathways. When researchers injected spike protein into the skulls of mice, they observed brain inflammation along with behavioural changes.",https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/science/new-insights-into-how-long-covid-affects-the-brain/article68955259.ece,health
"Preventing malaria using genetically modified malaria parasites

Premium Genetically modified malaria-causing parasites do not cause disease; they instead prime the immune system during the initial stage of their life cycle in the liver Two vaccines against malaria have been rolled out in some countries in Africa. Besides vaccines, scientists have been using genetically altered mosquitoes to stop the spread of malaria. One is the release of radiation-sterilised male mosquitoes to prevent eggs from hatching. Another is engineering mosquitoes that slow the growth of malaria-causing parasites in the gut thereby preventing transmission of malaria to humans. The other method is using genetically modified mosquitoes that can spread resistance to malaria-causing parasites by thriving and mating with wild mosquitoes. Now, in a radical approach, scientists have shifted their focus from genetic modification of malaria-causing mosquitoes to malaria-causing parasites. They have genetically modified malaria-causing parasites so that the parasites do not cause disease. Instead, they prime the immune system during the initial stage of their life cycle in the liver and before they enter the bloodstream. Malaria-causing parasites cause infection and symptoms begin to show only when they move into the bloodstream from the liver stage.",https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/science/preventing-malaria-using-genetically-modified-malaria-parasites/article68955241.ece,health

Premium Genome sequencing identified the PB2-E627K mutation in the British Columbia teenager, which is linked to faster replication in human cells and greater severity of illness, and likely emerged during the infection Avian influenza, commonly known as bird flu, is a viral infection primarily affecting birds. A global outbreak of H5N1, a highly pathogenic avian influenza virus, has been spreading across the world since late 2020, driven by a new emerging lineage of the virus — 2.3.4.4b. H5N1 has been a significant concern in global public health due to its potential to cause severe disease in humans and its ability to infect a wide range of hosts, including poultry, wild birds, and mammals. Since its emergence in the late 1990s, the virus has predominantly been an issue for the poultry industry, but sporadic human cases have raised alarms about its pandemic potential. However, recent human cases of H5N1 in British Columbia in Canada and California have increased concerns about the adaptability of the virus and possible mutations that could facilitate human-to-human transmission. In November 2024, a teenager from Fraser Health, British Columbia was diagnosed with H5N1. This is the first domestically acquired case of human H5N1 infection in Canada. The teenager initially experienced conjunctivitis, fever, and cough, which rapidly progressed to acute respiratory distress syndrome, requiring intensive care. Genomic sequencing revealed that the virus belonged to the 2.3.4.4b clade, genotype D1.1, consistent with strains found in wild birds in the Fraser Valley area and not directly related to outbreaks at poultry farms in British Columbia. The D1.1 is a different genotype than the one that has infected dairy workers in the U.S. and the child in California. Testing of household contacts of the patient, pets, nearby animals, and environmental samples returned negative results for influenza H5 and despite several efforts, health officials were not able to identify the definitive source of the teenager’s infection.",https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/emerging-h5n1-mutations-raise-risk-of-human-infections/article68928505.ece,health

Dark chocolate’s unique flavour is the result of a complex interaction of over 600 compounds. During the roasting process, the Maillard reaction (amino acids reacting with reducing sugars in the presence of heat ), creates its rich, earthy, and slightly bitter taste. Acids and sugars in the beans also play a role in balancing its flavour profile. It is often hailed as a guilt-free indulgence, and research also highlights the potential health benefits of cacao, dark chocolate’s primary ingredient. Packed with flavonoids, cacao may help reduce inflammation and support heart health, making it a favourite among health-conscious consumers.

Premium The story of biomedical waste management reminds us that progress often emerges from the depths of crisis: the stigma, fear, and tragedy surrounding HIV/AIDS indirectly gave rise to a cleaner, safer healthcare environment In August 1987, the beaches of the United States witnessed a chilling phenomenon dubbed the “Syringe Tide.” Used syringes and other medical waste, such as blood vials and body tissues, began appearing on the Jersey Shore and New York City beaches along the Atlantic coast. The sight of children playing with syringes became a vivid image that spurred a national outcry. The scene, reminiscent of a biological apocalypse, rattled the American public. The disaster was traced back to New York City’s improper waste disposal, dumping hazardous refuse into fresh landfills (now closed). Though hospital waste has always been unpleasant, its hazardous potential was grossly underestimated. This incident unfolded in the shadow of the AIDS epidemic as a mounting crisis. Just four years earlier, in 1983, two scientists, Luc Montagnier from France and Robert Gallo from the United States, had independently identified the virus responsible for AIDS. By the mid-1980s, HIV/AIDS was viewed as a biological death sentence, with little hope for a cure or vaccine. The virus’s primary target is immune cells, and medical intervention was extraordinarily challenging then.

"An ideal way to treat India’s corneal blindness problem
Premium",A ‘consent-driven donation’ approach is a step that can eliminate avoidable corneal vision loss,"Tejah Balantrapu,","An ideal way to treat India’s corneal blindness problem
Premium A ‘consent-driven donation’ approach is a step that can eliminate avoidable corneal vision loss Despite strong support for eye donation in India, with millions, including popular film actors, pledging to donate, an acute shortage of corneas persists. There is a need to perform about 1,00,000 corneal transplants every year, but only 30% of this need is being met. On the demand side, many fellow citizens lead a lifetime of avoidable sight loss, waiting for sight-restoring tissue. The solution on the supply side are the millions dying in Indian hospitals every day who are eligible to donate their tissues — but do not. What if we ‘presume consent’ and treat them all as cornea donors? News reports note that, indeed, a ‘presumed consent’ amendment to the Transplantation of Human Organs and Tissues Act (THOTA), 1994, is in the works to allow cornea retrieval from all eligible deaths in hospitals. Indian policymakers are seriously considering the ‘presumed consent’ approach to corneal donations because of the scale of the problem. The cornea is the thin, clear outer layer of the eye. Infection, accidents, or congenital conditions can turn it opaque. Corneal opacities are the second major cause of blindness in India among those who are 50 years and older, and the primary cause in those younger. An estimated 1.2 million people live with corneal opacities in India and about a third can be treated with a corneal transplant. These numbers make India one of the largest populations with corneal blindness in the world. However, most corneal blindness is preventable or treatable. For those eligible for treatment, corneal transplant surgery is an effective intervention. In fact, it is the most frequently performed transplant in the world. Critical to enabling corneal transplants is an ‘eye bank’, which handles ethically sourced corneas, processes them, and makes them available to eye surgeons.

Premium What is the controversy over the numbers? What is the difference in testing methodology? What are the issues raised in the Lancet study on controlling diabetes? Why are doctors concerned about the number of diabetics in India? What steps need to be taken? The story so far: On International Diabetes Day (November 14), a paper published in The Lancet, based on a global study, recorded over 800 million adults living with diabetes, with more than half not receiving treatment. According to the study, the total number of adults living with either Type 1 or Type 2 diabetes in the world has surpassed 800 million — over four times the total number in 1990. Of this, over a quarter (212 million) live in India, with another 148 million in China. The estimate came as a bit of a shock, because the last scientific countrywide estimate by the Indian Council of Medical Research-INDIAB study last year had pegged the number at slightly over 100 million. The nub of it is in the means used to measure blood sugar, experts have pointed out. The Lancet study, conducted by the NCD Risk Factor Collaboration (NCD-RisC), along with the World Health Organization (WHO), used data from over 140 million people (18+ years) culled from more than 1,000 studies in different countries. They estimated trends from 1990 to 2022 in diabetes prevalence and treatment for 200 countries and territories. As such they had to use what was available as data in these nations — picking fasting glucose or HbA1C or a three-month glycated haemoglobin average. The ICMR study, however, used a fasting measure and a two-hour post prandial value to come up with the number of people who have elevated blood sugar levels.",https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/health/how-should-india-tackle-diabetes-load/article68903259.ece,health

Premium A recent paper has garnered interest for discovering that white blood cells activated by severe COVID-19 demonstrate cancer-fighting abilities. How does this work? Cancer, often called the “emperor of all maladies,” remains a formidable adversary despite decades of scientific progress. However, research in recent years has brought us closer to unlocking new ways to combat it. A study from Northwestern University in Chicago, published in the November issue of The Journal of Clinical Investigation, has gained attention for discovering that white blood cells activated by severe COVID-19 demonstrate cancer-fighting abilities. Working with laboratory mice, researchers showed that the spread of cancer, also known as metastasis, could be slowed by a specialised type of white blood cell called induced non-classical monocytes (I-NCMs). These cells can be generated through severe infections like COVID-19 or by using certain chemicals. Once activated, I-NCMs are able to leave blood vessels and migrate to tumours, where they launch an attack on cancer cells. COVID-19 is known to cause worse outcomes for older individuals and those weakened by ailments including cancer. However, there are rare reports of cancer going into remission (absence of disease) following COVID-19.",https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/health/using-the-bodys-own-defences-to-fight-cancer-new-research-offers-a-clue-from-covid-19/article68897661.ece,health

"Winter skincare: A practical guide to healthy skin for all ages 
Premium","A tailored approach that considers age, lifestyle and skin health is crucial to maintaining resilient skin throughout the cold season",Monisha Madhumita,"Winter skincare: A practical guide to healthy skin for all ages 
Premium A tailored approach that considers age, lifestyle and skin health is crucial to maintaining resilient skin throughout the cold season Winter presents unique challenges for the skin. As temperatures drop and humidity plummets, the air pulls moisture away from the skin, leaving it dry, flaky, and prone to irritation. For those with preexisting skin conditions like eczema, acne, or psoriasis, winter can aggravate symptoms, making proper care critical. While general advice such as applying moisturisers and avoiding hot showers is helpful, winter skincare demands a more thoughtful and tailored approach that considers age, lifestyle and skin health. The colder months affect skin health primarily through dehydration. The skin’s natural barrier, which retains moisture and protects against environmental irritants, becomes compromised. This breakdown can lead to conditions such as redness, cracks, and increased sensitivity, paving the way for infections or exacerbation of chronic issues. Understanding these mechanisms is key to building a sustainable and effective routine that ensures skin health throughout the season.",https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/health/winter-skincare-a-practical-guide-to-healthy-skin-for-all-ages/article68954923.ece,health

Ray Hospital, in a statement said, “Lakhs of soldiers from our country shed their blood to bring freedom to Bangladesh, so when they insult our national flag, we cannot maintain cordial relations with them.” This statement made by the hospital’s director Subhrangshu Bhakta, said that they would offer no treatment or medical assistance to any Bangladeshi nationals and had a ‘no entry’ policy for Bangladeshi nationals.",https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/health/amid-turmoil-kolkata-hospitals-say-they-will-not-discriminate-based-on-nationality-will-continue-to-treat-bangladeshi-patients/article68954372.ece,health

"New insights into how Long COVID affects the brain
Premium",No Subtitle,Rajeev  Jayadevan,"New insights into how Long COVID affects the brain
Premium No Subtitle Long COVID is a condition marked by multiple persistent symptoms that sometimes occur even after mild infections. Among these, memory loss, brain fog and sleep disturbances indicate brain involvement. MRI scans done before and after COVID-19 show shrinkage in certain brain regions, pointing to tissue loss. This raises crucial questions: how does a respiratory virus go on to affect the brain? And what drives brain inflammation in these patients? Two recent papers provide insights into how the virus might indirectly affect the brain. A study published in Cell Host & Microbe concludes that continued presence of the virus spike protein could be triggering inflammation and neurodegenerative changes in the brain. The spike also activates inflammatory pathways. When researchers injected spike protein into the skulls of mice, they observed brain inflammation along with behavioural changes.",https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/science/new-insights-into-how-long-covid-affects-the-brain/article68955259.ece,health
"Preventing malaria using genetically modified malaria parasites
Premium",Genetically modified malaria-causing parasites do not cause disease; they instead prime the immune system during the initial stage of their life cycle in the liver,R. Prasad,"Preventing malaria using genetically modified malaria parasites
Premium Genetically modified malaria-causing parasites do not cause disease; they instead prime the immune system during the initial stage of their life cycle in the liver Two vaccines against malaria have been rolled out in some countries in Africa. Besides vaccines, scientists have been using genetically altered mosquitoes to stop the spread of malaria. One is the release of radiation-sterilised male mosquitoes to prevent eggs from hatching. Another is engineering mosquitoes that slow the growth of malaria-causing parasites in the gut thereby preventing transmission of malaria to humans. The other method is using genetically modified mosquitoes that can spread resistance to malaria-causing parasites by thriving and mating with wild mosquitoes. Now, in a radical approach, scientists have shifted their focus from genetic modification of malaria-causing mosquitoes to malaria-causing parasites. They have genetically modified malaria-causing parasites so that the parasites do not cause disease. Instead, they prime the immune system during the initial stage of their life cycle in the liver and before they enter the bloodstream. Malaria-causing parasites cause infection and symptoms begin to show only when they move into the bloodstream from the liver stage.",https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/science/preventing-malaria-using-genetically-modified-malaria-parasites/article68955241.ece,health

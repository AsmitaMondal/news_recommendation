Premium","A look at the claim made in the Economic Survey (2023-24), of India having decoupled its economic growth from greenhouse gas emissions","Badri Narayanan  Gopalakrishnan,","The issue of India’s economic growth versus emissions
Premium A look at the claim made in the Economic Survey (2023-24), of India having decoupled its economic growth from greenhouse gas emissions The Indian economy has consistently showcased its robust growth over the past few decades. But higher economic growth is believed to have come with increasing environmental pressure, notably through higher greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. However, India’s Economic Survey (2023-24) claims that India has decoupled its economic growth from GHG emissions, as between 2005 and 2019, India’s GDP grew at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 7%, while emissions rose at a CAGR of just 4%. This raises a crucial question: has India really decoupled its economic growth from GHG emissions? And, what does this mean for sustainable development? Decoupling refers to breaking the link between economic growth and environmental degradation. Historically, economic growth is found to be positively related with environmental degradation, as this growth is believed to be a driver of GHG emissions. However, with the growing climate crisis, the imperative to reduce emissions while ensuring continued economic growth has gained global traction.",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/op-ed/the-issue-of-indias-economic-growth-versus-emissions/article68962376.ece,business

Premium Billionaire Warren Buffet has given away an amount of almost 52 billion dollars to various charities. While such a move is no doubt commendable, one must also question the processes generating the concentration of such wealth in the first place, regardless of whether it is to be used for philanthropy or not Billionaire Warren Buffet, with a net worth of almost $121 billion by some estimates, has maintained his pledge of giving away his wealth. In a recent message to shareholders of Berkshire Hathaway, he has mentioned a transfer of his wealth to foundations overseen by his children, a total amount of around 870 million dollars. In all, it is estimated that he has given away an amount of $52 billion. Mr. Buffet’s recent message has captured the attention of mainstream discourse as it has outlined his social philosophy with regard to wealth and its place in society. Mr. Buffet believes that wealth should be used to equalise opportunities, that the luck that favoured certain individuals and helped them get rich should be extended after one’s death in order to help those less fortunate. While it is not wrong to amass and accumulate wealth during one’s lifetime, allowing it to build across generations is a problem for society. While it is no doubt commendable that Mr. Buffet wishes to give away his fortune, one must also question the processes generating the concentration of such wealth in the first place, regardless of whether it is to be used for philanthropy or not. Inequality is not a question of luck, but of specific policy institutions determined by society. In a world of spiralling inequality, both private philanthropy and the problems it tries to solve are two sides of the same coin, emerging from the very same set of social processes.",https://www.thehindu.com/business/Economy/the-place-of-charity-in-an-unequal-society/article68962838.ece,business

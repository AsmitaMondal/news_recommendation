"Twelve days that shook Syria
Premium",The rapid collapse of government forces in Aleppo stunned both the militants and the regime alike,Stanly Johny,"Twelve days that shook Syria
Premium The rapid collapse of government forces in Aleppo stunned both the militants and the regime alike The Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS), the Syrian Islamist militant group, had been preparing for months for a large-scale offensive against regime forces. The civil war was quiet for years, particularly after the regime of President Bashar al-Assad captured most of its lost territories — including Aleppo, Hama and Homs. The HTS, formerly al-Nusra Front, the Syrian arm of al-Qaeda, had built a statelet in Idlib, in northwestern Syria, under the leadership of its ‘emir’, Abu Muhammed al-Jolani. The HTS and its ally Syrian National Army (SNA), formerly the Free Syrian Army, had informed Turkiye, their patron, at least six months ago about the offensive plan, according to a Reuters report. And Ankara had given its tacit approval. Mr. Assad’s troops were in a bad shape. Soldiers were poorly paid and lacked motivation. The country never recovered from the scars of the civil war. Under crippling American sanctions, its finances were in shambles. During the peak of the civil war, in 2015-16, Mr. Assad had heavily relied on his external allies for security — Russia, Iran and Hezbollah. Now, the situation was different. The Russians were focused on Ukraine. Iran lost a host of its Syria commanders to Israeli strikes. Hezbollah had been weakened in a year-long war with Israel. The HTS launched its offensive on November 27, the day Israel and Lebanon signed a ceasefire. On the 12th day, the Assad regime fell, sending tremors across the region.",https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/twelve-days-that-shook-syria/article68969014.ece,international

"What is the delay in forming a government in Austria? | Explained
Premium",Why are Austria’s mainstream parties refusing to enter into a coalition with the far-right Freedom Party? Why did the Austrian President refuse to invite the FPO to lead the country?,Garimella Subramaniam,"What is the delay in forming a government in Austria? | Explained
Premium Why are Austria’s mainstream parties refusing to enter into a coalition with the far-right Freedom Party? Why did the Austrian President refuse to invite the FPO to lead the country? The story so far: The Austrian chancellor Karl Nehammer’s ruling People’s Party (OVP) has inched closer to heading Vienna’s next coalition government. The party was the runner-up in the September 29 elections and its vote slump, compared with the 2019 polls, was the biggest loss any ruling party has sustained. The OVP’s prospective coalition partner, the Social Democrats (SPO) put up their worst ever electoral showing since World War II. Conversely, the far-right, xenophobic, Eurosceptic, anti-Muslim and pro-Russian Freedom Party (FPO), emerged the largest entity, albeit without a majority. All of Austria’s mainstream parties have refused to form a government with the FPO. The only ground the ultra-right party has gained since the polls is the election of one of its members as the parliament’s speaker. Among the reasons for parties’ antipathy towards the FPO are the latter’s backing for Russia in its full-scale aggression against Ukraine. The FPO has veered further to the extreme right under its current leader Herbert Kickl, who styles himself as the ‘people’s chancellor,’ in a not so oblique reference to Adolf Hitler, and regards Hungary’s autocratic President Viktor Orban as his role model. As interior minister in the short-lived 2017-2019 OVP-FPO coalition government, Mr. Kickl shut down mosques in a crackdown against the “Islamisation” of Austria. His infamous raids on the nation’s intelligence services severely compromised collaboration with international agencies. He continues to advocate for the re-migration of citizens of foreign origin as part of the mission to create a homogenous Austrian society.",https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/what-is-the-delay-in-forming-a-government-in-austria-explained/article68962856.ece,international

Premium The man picked by Islamic State leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi to establish a branch in Syria is now leading the country’s most potent militant organisation that has made dramatic territorial advances in recent weeks “We deputised al-Jolani, who is one of our soldiers, with a group of our sons, and pushed them from Iraq to Syria to meet with our cells in Syria and set for them the plans and drew for them the policy of work,” Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, the then-chief of the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS) announced on April 2, 2014, referring to al-Qaeda’s Syria arm, Jabhat al-Nusra. Abu Muhammad al-Jolani, a Saudi-born Syrian jihadist was a lieutenant of Baghdadi. It was Jolani he turned to when he decided to expand his jihadist network into Syria, where a civil war broke out in 2011. “We supplied them with half of what is in the treasury every month, and supplied them with men who had battlefield experience from among the muhajirun [“emigrants”; foreign fighters] and ansar [“supporters”; local jihadists], so they did well next to their brothers from the ardent sons of Syria,” said Baghdadi, taking credit for the creation of a-Nusra. Baghdadi was killed in an American airstrike in Syria in October 2019. The ‘caliphate’ he built, which at its peak had spread from eastern Syria’s Deir Ezzor to Iraq’s Mosul, was destroyed. The Islamic State, the jihadist organisation Baghdadi created and led, has been scattered and weakened ever since. But Jolani, the man Baghdadi chose to lead his network in Syria, is today the leader of Syria’s armed insurgency. He is the ‘emir’ of the ‘Syrian Salvation Government’, which is based in the northwestern province of Idlib, and the leader of Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS), the main opposition jihadist group. In the last week of November, when the whole region’s focus was on a ceasefire deal between Israel and Hezbollah, Jolani’s jihadists launched a surprise attack on Syrian forces from Idlib. Before most people understood what was actually happening, the HTS captured Aleppo, Syria’s second-largest city.",https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/abu-muhammad-al-jolani-syrias-jihadist-in-chief/article68959633.ece,international

Why did talks fail at Busan? Is another round of negotiations likely?,Jacob Koshy,"Why can’t the world agree on a plastic ban? 
Premium How much plastic waste is produced now? What is the most common type of plastic waste found in the environment? Why are several countries averse to tackling plastic pollution? Why did talks fail at Busan? Is another round of negotiations likely? The story so far:The 5th Intergovernmental Negotiating Committee (INC-5) on plastic pollution was a conclave of delegations from about 170 countries mandated to establish a legally binding treaty to end plastic pollution, informally called the Global Plastics Treaty. Despite a week of meetings, the INC-5 failed to meet its mandate. The United Nations Environment Assembly (UNEA) resolved in March 2022 to ‘end plastic pollution, including in the marine environment.’ To that end, INC committees were constituted and tasked with negotiating a treaty before the end of 2024. Over the last two years, countries met five times, and attempted to bridge divergent views on how to end plastic pollution. Several countries are enthusiastic about ways and means to encourage recycling and prohibit certain plastics that lead to littering — India for instance has banned single-use plastic since 2022 — but many of them are reluctant to limit plastic production. Several countries are either petro-states or those that have significant industries that manufacture plastic polymers. Before the latest, and what was expected to be the last round of negotiations, began in Busan, South Korea, the Chair of the INC-5, Luis Vayas Valdivieso, circulated a draft text called a ‘non paper.’ This was roughly a synthesis of the views of all countries on managing plastic production but in the end, it turned out that despite long negotiations, the chasm between countries who viewed addressing plastic pollution as a waste management problem, and those that saw it as unachievable without cutting its production at source, was one that was too wide to bridge.",https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/energy-and-environment/why-cant-the-world-agree-on-a-plastic-ban/article68959805.ece,international

Premium The Indian origin Republican, who once vowed to ‘shut down the FBI’, has been picked by Donald Trump to lead the Bureau Part three of the children’s book, The Plot Against the King, written by Kash Patel, President-elect Donald Trump’s nominee for Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), talks about the “MAGA king” and his quest to “take down Comma-la-la-la and reclaim his throne”. One can safely assume that the ‘king’ here is Mr. Trump and ‘Comma-la-la-la’, the incumbent U.S. Vice-President Kamala Harris. This also gives us an idea of what Mr. Patel, who owns a charitable foundation called Fight with Kash which among other things funds defamation lawsuits, and a clothing line which sells a variety of merchandise with his logo ‘K$H’, stands for — unabashedly brazen and unapologetically loyal to the incoming U.S. President. Mr. Patel, who was born in 1980 to Indian immigrant parents (who first moved to Canada from East Africa in the 1970s and then to the U.S.) started his career as a public defender in the State of Florida, following which he joined the U.S. Justice Department as a counter-terrorism prosecutor. A member of the Republican party, he was then appointed to the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence (HPSCI) in 2017. He worked as senior aide to Devin Nunes, the chair of the HPSCI and a staunch Trump supporter. Mr. Patel rose up the ranks within Mr. Trump’s inner circle when he scathingly criticised the FBI’s investigation into alleged Russian interference in the 2016 U.S. Presidential election. He, along with Mr. Nunes, authored the ‘Nunes memo’ which accused the FBI of being politically motivated in its investigation.

Premium The rapid collapse of government forces in Aleppo stunned both the militants and the regime alike The Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS), the Syrian Islamist militant group, had been preparing for months for a large-scale offensive against regime forces. The civil war was quiet for years, particularly after the regime of President Bashar al-Assad captured most of its lost territories — including Aleppo, Hama and Homs. The HTS, formerly al-Nusra Front, the Syrian arm of al-Qaeda, had built a statelet in Idlib, in northwestern Syria, under the leadership of its ‘emir’, Abu Muhammed al-Jolani. The HTS and its ally Syrian National Army (SNA), formerly the Free Syrian Army, had informed Turkiye, their patron, at least six months ago about the offensive plan, according to a Reuters report. And Ankara had given its tacit approval. Mr. Assad’s troops were in a bad shape. Soldiers were poorly paid and lacked motivation. The country never recovered from the scars of the civil war. Under crippling American sanctions, its finances were in shambles. During the peak of the civil war, in 2015-16, Mr. Assad had heavily relied on his external allies for security — Russia, Iran and Hezbollah. Now, the situation was different. The Russians were focused on Ukraine. Iran lost a host of its Syria commanders to Israeli strikes. Hezbollah had been weakened in a year-long war with Israel. The HTS launched its offensive on November 27, the day Israel and Lebanon signed a ceasefire. On the 12th day, the Assad regime fell, sending tremors across the region.",https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/twelve-days-that-shook-syria/article68969014.ece,international

"Twelve days that shook Syria
Premium",The rapid collapse of government forces in Aleppo stunned both the militants and the regime alike,Stanly Johny,"Twelve days that shook Syria
Premium The rapid collapse of government forces in Aleppo stunned both the militants and the regime alike The Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS), the Syrian Islamist militant group, had been preparing for months for a large-scale offensive against regime forces. The civil war was quiet for years, particularly after the regime of President Bashar al-Assad captured most of its lost territories — including Aleppo, Hama and Homs. The HTS, formerly al-Nusra Front, the Syrian arm of al-Qaeda, had built a statelet in Idlib, in northwestern Syria, under the leadership of its ‘emir’, Abu Muhammed al-Jolani. The HTS and its ally Syrian National Army (SNA), formerly the Free Syrian Army, had informed Turkiye, their patron, at least six months ago about the offensive plan, according to a Reuters report. And Ankara had given its tacit approval. Mr. Assad’s troops were in a bad shape. Soldiers were poorly paid and lacked motivation. The country never recovered from the scars of the civil war. Under crippling American sanctions, its finances were in shambles. During the peak of the civil war, in 2015-16, Mr. Assad had heavily relied on his external allies for security — Russia, Iran and Hezbollah. Now, the situation was different. The Russians were focused on Ukraine. Iran lost a host of its Syria commanders to Israeli strikes. Hezbollah had been weakened in a year-long war with Israel. The HTS launched its offensive on November 27, the day Israel and Lebanon signed a ceasefire. On the 12th day, the Assad regime fell, sending tremors across the region.",https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/twelve-days-that-shook-syria/article68969014.ece,international

"Twelve days that shook Syria
Premium",The rapid collapse of government forces in Aleppo stunned both the militants and the regime alike,Stanly Johny,"Twelve days that shook Syria
Premium The rapid collapse of government forces in Aleppo stunned both the militants and the regime alike The Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS), the Syrian Islamist militant group, had been preparing for months for a large-scale offensive against regime forces. The civil war was quiet for years, particularly after the regime of President Bashar al-Assad captured most of its lost territories — including Aleppo, Hama and Homs. The HTS, formerly al-Nusra Front, the Syrian arm of al-Qaeda, had built a statelet in Idlib, in northwestern Syria, under the leadership of its ‘emir’, Abu Muhammed al-Jolani. The HTS and its ally Syrian National Army (SNA), formerly the Free Syrian Army, had informed Turkiye, their patron, at least six months ago about the offensive plan, according to a Reuters report. And Ankara had given its tacit approval. Mr. Assad’s troops were in a bad shape. Soldiers were poorly paid and lacked motivation. The country never recovered from the scars of the civil war. Under crippling American sanctions, its finances were in shambles. During the peak of the civil war, in 2015-16, Mr. Assad had heavily relied on his external allies for security — Russia, Iran and Hezbollah. Now, the situation was different. The Russians were focused on Ukraine. Iran lost a host of its Syria commanders to Israeli strikes. Hezbollah had been weakened in a year-long war with Israel. The HTS launched its offensive on November 27, the day Israel and Lebanon signed a ceasefire. On the 12th day, the Assad regime fell, sending tremors across the region.",https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/twelve-days-that-shook-syria/article68969014.ece,international

The HTS and its ally Syrian National Army (SNA), formerly the Free Syrian Army, had informed Turkiye, their patron, at least six months ago about the offensive plan, according to a Reuters report. And Ankara had given its tacit approval. Mr. Assad’s troops were in a bad shape. Soldiers were poorly paid and lacked motivation. The country never recovered from the scars of the civil war. Under crippling American sanctions, its finances were in shambles. During the peak of the civil war, in 2015-16, Mr. Assad had heavily relied on his external allies for security — Russia, Iran and Hezbollah. Now, the situation was different. The Russians were focused on Ukraine. Iran lost a host of its Syria commanders to Israeli strikes. Hezbollah had been weakened in a year-long war with Israel. The HTS launched its offensive on November 27, the day Israel and Lebanon signed a ceasefire. On the 12th day, the Assad regime fell, sending tremors across the region.",https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/twelve-days-that-shook-syria/article68969014.ece,international

Premium The rapid collapse of government forces in Aleppo stunned both the militants and the regime alike The Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS), the Syrian Islamist militant group, had been preparing for months for a large-scale offensive against regime forces. The civil war was quiet for years, particularly after the regime of President Bashar al-Assad captured most of its lost territories — including Aleppo, Hama and Homs. The HTS, formerly al-Nusra Front, the Syrian arm of al-Qaeda, had built a statelet in Idlib, in northwestern Syria, under the leadership of its ‘emir’, Abu Muhammed al-Jolani. The HTS and its ally Syrian National Army (SNA), formerly the Free Syrian Army, had informed Turkiye, their patron, at least six months ago about the offensive plan, according to a Reuters report. And Ankara had given its tacit approval. Mr. Assad’s troops were in a bad shape. Soldiers were poorly paid and lacked motivation. The country never recovered from the scars of the civil war. Under crippling American sanctions, its finances were in shambles. During the peak of the civil war, in 2015-16, Mr. Assad had heavily relied on his external allies for security — Russia, Iran and Hezbollah. Now, the situation was different. The Russians were focused on Ukraine. Iran lost a host of its Syria commanders to Israeli strikes. Hezbollah had been weakened in a year-long war with Israel. The HTS launched its offensive on November 27, the day Israel and Lebanon signed a ceasefire.
